\subsection{Distillation column model}
    The previously described column model is based on the assumption of steady-state operations. This means that all
    derivatives with respect to time are zero. While a model like that offers valuable insight into the operation
    of a process many aspects remain unclear. Questions of operability or stability of the process, or if a given
    steady state can actually be acquired in finite are beyond the scope of steady state models. In order to
    supply answers to aforementioned questions, dynamic versions of the previously discussed unit models
    are needed. The aim is to retain the capability for structural optimization for the dynamic models.

    First the balance equations have to be rewritten in dynamic form. To do so reservoir terms or holdups
    are introduced. Namely the component holdups $n_{ij}$ and internal energy $U_j$ for each stage.
    With that the component balance equations as presented in the previous section can now be rewritten as
        \Eqml{eq:col:CompBalance_opt}{
    		\left(1 - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \zeta^R_k \right) \fracdd{n_{ij}}{t} = \left(1 + s_j^V\right)
                \cdot V_j \cdot y_{i,j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right) \cdot L_j \cdot x_{i,j} - V_{j+1}
                \cdot y_{i,j+1} \\ \hfill - L_{j-1} \cdot x_{i,j-1}
                - \sum_{l=1}^{n_F} \zeta_{lj} \cdot F_j \cdot z_{i,j} - \zeta^R_j \cdot V_N \cdot y_{iN}, \hfill%
                \\ \eqannote{i = 1 \dots n_C-1, \quad j = 1 \dots N, \quad k = 1 \dots n_F, \quad l = 1 \dots n_F}.
    	}%
    While the internal energy balances become
        \Eqml{eq:col:EnergyBalance}{
    		\left(1 - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \zeta^R_k \right) \fracdd{U_j}{t} = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot h^V_{j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)
                \cdot L_j \cdot h^L_{j} - V_{j+1} \cdot h^V_{j+1} \\ \hfill - L_{j-1} \cdot h^L_{j-1}
                - \sum_{k=1}^{n_F} \zeta_{kj} \cdot F_k \cdot h^{F}_{j} - \zeta^R_j \cdot V_N \cdot h^V_{N}, \hfill
                \\ \eqannote{i = 1 \dots n_C, \quad j = 1 \dots n_S, \quad k = 1 \dots n_F}.
    	}%
    \ncr{n_{ij}}{holdup of component $i$ on stage $j$ }{mol}
    \ncr{U_j}{internal energy holdup on stage $j$}{J}
    The summation terms in front of the derivatives are needed if integer optimization is to be carried out with the model.
    In the steady-state case, no equilibrium took place at inactive stages. However in this case, there are the holdups
    in connection with the column hydraulics to be considered. While still no equilibrium should take place,
    even inactive trays will have to have a holdup. By means of the summations, the material balance is
    effectively transformed into a steady state equation, such that inactive trays will operate at steady-state
    with constant holdups, and therefore have no effect on the active part of the column.

    In addition to the balance equations further constituent equations need to be introduced. From the
    steady state model we know the equilibrium equations
    \Eq{eq:col:Kxy}{
        y_{ij} & = K_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}, \eqanncs,
    }%
    %
    and the summation equations
    %
    \Eq{eq:col:summ_dyn}{
        1 & = \sum_i^{n_c} y_{ij} \eqanns, \\
        1 & = \sum_i^{n_c} x_{ij} \eqanns.
    }%
    %
    Furthermore defining equations for the accumulation of moles on each stage in vapour $n_j^V$ and
    liquid $n_j^L$ phase are needed
    %
    \Eq{eq:col:holdup}{
        n_{ij} & = x_{ij} n_j^L + y_{ij} n_j^V \eqanncs.
    }%
    \ncr{n_j^L}{liquid molar holdup on stage $j$}{mol}
    \ncr{n_j^V}{vapour molar holdup on stage $j$}{mol}
    %
    These holdups will fill the volume of a given stage $V_{stage}$. Thus a volume constraint
    can be written as
    %
    \Eq{eq:dyn:volconstraint}{
        V_{stage} = \frac{n_j^V}{\varrho_j^V} + \frac{n_j^L}{\varrho_j^L} \eqanns.
    }%
    \ncr{V_{stage}}{stage volume}{m^3}
    %
    The internal energy in a stage corresponds to its enthalpy, reduced by pressure term
    \Eq{eq:dyn:internergyholdup}{
        U_j = n^L_j \cdot h^L_j + n^V_j \cdot h^V_j - p_j \cdot V_{stage}
    }
    %
    As we are no longer dealing in steady state hydraulic equations need to be introduced,
    which determine the liquid and vapour flow rates leaving a separation stage. As the
    mechanisms driving these flows might be very different depending on the type of internals
    used, it is not surprising that the corresponding equations are also very different. In the
    presented model implementation, both trayed columns and structured packings can be handled accordingly.

    \subsubsection{Trayed hydraulics}

%            \end{subfigure}
        \end{figure}

        Trayed column hydraulics can be approximated by the following system of equations.
        All equations presented here were taken from \cite{Lockett.2009}.

        The liquid flow rates are calculated from the well established francis formula ,
        derived from the law of Bernoulli and taking effects like bubbling into account
        %
        \Eq{eq:col:francis}{
            L_j = \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{2 g} \varrho^L_j \ell_{weir} \Phi h_{ow}^{\frac{2}{3}} \eqanns.
        }%
        \ncc{g}{gravitational constant}{\frac{m}{s^2}}
        \ncr{\ell_{weir}}{length of tray weir}{m}
        \ncr{h_{ow}}{height over weir}{m}
        \ncg{\Phi}{relative froth density}{-}
        %
        Where $h_{ow}$ denotes the height of the liquid over the weir, which can be calculated from the
        froth height $h_f$ and the weir height $h_w$
        \Eq{}{
            h_{ow} = h_f - h_w.
        }
        \ncr{h_f}{froth height}{m}
        \ncr{h_w}{weir height}{m}
        %
        While the weir height is a tray design parameter the froth height is computed from the clear
        liquid height and the relative froth density
        \Eq{}{
            h_f = \frac{n^L \, MW^L}{A_{active} \, \varrho^L \, \Phi}.
        }
        \ncr{A_{active}}{active tray area}{m^2}
        %
        Lastly in terms of liquid flow rates, the relative froth density is dependent on the
        degree of aeration within the liquid, expressed by the aeration factor $\beta$
        from an empirical equation
        \Eq{}{
            \beta_j & = 1 - 0.3593 \left( \frac{V_{j-1} \, MW^V_{j-1}}{A_{active} \, \sqrt{\varrho_{j-1}}} \right)^{0.177709} \eqanns, \\
            \Phi_j & = 2 \beta_j - 1.
        }
        \ncg{\beta}{aeration factor}{-}

        The pressure difference between stages is the driving force for the vapour streams. The pressure drop
        is modeled as having two contributions, the dry and wet pressure drop. While dry pressure drop
        stems from the vapour flowing through the holes with in tray, the wet pressure drop is caused by the liquid
        holdup on the stage.
        \Eq{eq:col:dp_dyn}{
            p_j - p_{j+1} = h_{j}^{liq} \varrho_j^L g + 0.5 \xi \varrho_{j+1}^V \left( \frac{q_{j+1}^V}{A_h} \right)^2
        }%

    \subsubsection{Structured packing hydraulics}
    \label{sec:mathpro:dynamic:strpackhyd}
%        \begin{figure}
%            \input{Pictures/packing_geo}
%        \end{figure}

        Structured packings and their hydraulic behaviour are currently still under investigation. The number
        of available correlations for calculation of internal flow-rates is much more limited than for trays or even
        dumped packings. Among the most established models is the one developed by Bravo et al. \cite{Rocha.1993} at the
        University of Texas. This model has been extended to be valid in the loading region and account for different types
        of packing material \cite{Gualito.1997}. As main linking factor between vapour and liquid flow-rates as well as
        the pressure drop, the liquid holdup has bee identified by the authors. It is expressed in dimensionless form $h_t$ in
        terms of the corrugation side $S$, and the film thickness $\delta$
        \Eq{eq:dyn:dimlessholdup}{
            h_L = \frac{4}{S} \, \delta.
        }
        \ncr{h_L}{dimesionless holdup}{-}
        \ncg{\delta}{film thickness}{m}
        \ncr{S}{corrugation side}{m}
        %
        One very important factor while estimating the hydraulic behaviour is the dry pressure drop per meter packing $\delta p_{dry}$.
        Within in the presented model it is estimated by
        \Eq{eq:dyn:drydp}{
            \delta p_{dry} = \left( \frac{\varrho^G}{\varrho_{air, 1 bar}} \right)^{0.4} \left( \frac{C_1 \varrho^G v_G^2}{S \epsilon^2
                (\sin \Theta)^2} + \frac{C_2 \mu_G v_G}{S^2 \epsilon \sin \Theta} \right)
        }
        \ncg{\Theta}{corrugation angle}{rad}
        \ncg{\mu_G}{vapour viscosity}{Pa \cdot s}
        \ncg{\epsilon}{packing void fraction}{-}
        \ncr{v_G}{vapour velocity}{\frac{m}{s}}
        \ncr{\delta p_{dry}}{dry pressure drop}{\frac{Pa}{m}}
        \ncr{C_1}{packing constant}{}
        \ncr{C_2}{packing constant}{}
        %
        Another perquisite for calculating the holdup is the knowledge of the amount of wetted area of the available
        surface area within the packing. It seems reasonable to assume that this will be dependent on the characteristic
        of the liquid flow through the packing. To characterize the current, well known dimensionless numbers are
        used. Namely \emph{Weber} ($We$), \emph{Froude} ($Fr$) and Reynolds ($Re$) numbers
        \Eq{}{
            We & = \frac{v_L^2 \varrho_L S}{\sigma}, \\
            Fr & = \frac{v_L^2}{S g}, \\
            Re & = \frac{v_L S \varrho_L}{\mu_L}
        }
        \ncg{\mu_L}{liquid viscosity}{Pa \cdot s}
        \ncr{v_L}{liquid velocity}{\frac{m}{s}}
        %
        With that an approximation for the holdup correction factor $F_t$ due to partial wetting can be expressed as
        \Eq{eq:dyn:wettedarea}{
            F_t = \frac{A_1 \left( We \, Fr \right)^{0.15} S^{A_2}}{Re^{0.2} \, \epsilon^{0.6}
                (1 - 0.93 \cos \gamma) (\sin \Theta)^{0.3} }
        }
        %
        \Eq{}{
            h_L = \left( \frac{4 F_t}{S} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} \left\{ \frac{3 \mu_L v_L}{\varrho_L \epsilon \sin \Theta
                g \left[ \left( \frac{\varrho_L - \varrho_G}{\varrho_L} \right) \left(1 - \frac{\delta p}{\delta p_{flood}} \right) \right]} \right\}^{\frac{1}{3}}
        }
    %

\subsection{Integrated condenser \& reboiler unit}
    \todo{include Integrated condenser / reboiler unit}

    As it has been stated on several occasions the condenser reboiler unit is essential in the cryogenic air separation process.
    Even more so, when we consider the dynamics behaviour of the process. In order to model this unit, it is assumed that
    all vapour entering the stage will be condensed, thus the unit is regarded as total condenser. Furthermore the holdups on the
    condenser side are assumed to negligible. The reboiler side on the other hand is modeled as an equilibrium stage much like
    the stages within the column.

    \subsubsection{Reboiler side}
        As the reboiler side behaves like an equilibrium stage, the governing equations are very similar to those for
        a stage inside the columns. Hence they will be given without much further comment.

        The material balances
        \Eq{}{
            \fracdd{n_i^{reb}}{t} = L_{reb}^{in} \cdot x_{i, reb}^{in} - V_{reb}^{out} \cdot y_i^{reb}
                - L_{reb}^{out} \cdot x_i^{reb}, \eqannc.
        }
        \ncr{n_i^{reb}}{molar holdup of component $i$ in reboiler}{kmol}
        \ncr{L_{reb}^{in}}{liquid reboiler influx}{\frac{kmol}{s}}
        \ncr{L_{reb}^{out}}{liquid reboiler outflow}{\frac{kmol}{s}}
        \ncr{V_{reb}^{out}}{vapour reboiler outflow}{\frac{kmol}{s}}
        \ncr{y_{i}^{reb}}{reboiler vapour mole fractions}{-}
        \ncr{x_{i}^{reb}}{reboiler liquid mole fractions}{-}
        Internal energy balance
        \Eq{}{
            \fracdd{U_{reb}}{t} = L_{reb}^{in} \cdot h_{in}^{reb} - V_{reb}^{out} \cdot h_{V}^{reb}
                - L_{reb}^{out} \cdot h_{L}^{reb} + Q_{CR}.
        }
        \ncr{U_{reb}}{reboiler internal energy holdup}{kJ}
        \ncr{h_{L}^{reb}}{reboiler liquid enthalpy}{\frac{kJ}{kmol}}
        \ncr{h_{V}^{reb}}{reboiler vapour enthalpy}{\frac{kJ}{kmol}}
        In addition to the balances the equilibrium and summation equations are necessary to complete
        the equations system.

        As for the trays hydraulic equations determine the flowrates leaving the unit. For the liquid
        outlet Bernoulli's principle was used to derive an equation
        \Eq{}{
            L_{reb}^{out} = A_{\text{valve}} \varrho_L \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot \left( \Delta p + \tilde{\varrho}_L g h\right)}{\tilde{\varrho}_L}},
        }
        disregarding the height difference an equation for the vapour flowrate can be derived
        \Eq{}{
            V_{reb}^{out} = A_{\text{valve}} \varrho_V \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta p}{\tilde{\varrho}_V}}.
        }

    \subsubsection{Condenser side}
        For a total condenser disregarding reservoir terms the mass balances become trivial
        \Eq{}{
            L_{con}^{out} = V_{con}^{in}.
        }
        To ensure bubble point temperature a summation as well as an equilibrium expression are included
        \Eq{}{
            1 & = \sum_i^{n_C} K_i x_{i,con}, \eqannc, \\
            x_{i, con} & = y_{i, con}^{in}, \eqannote{i = 1 \dots n_C - 1}.
        }
        An energy balance around the condenser side determines the transferred energy
        \Eq{}{
            Q_{CR} = L_{con} \cdot \left( h_{con}^{in} - h_{con}^{out} \right).
        }

    \subsubsection{Heat exchange}
        As the transferred energy is determined form the condenser energy balance, the temperature
        difference between condenser and reboiler can be calculated by means of
        \Eq{}{
            Q_{CR} = \alpha A_{HX} \cdot \left( T_{con} - T_{reb} \right).
        }
        Roffel et al \cite{Roffel.2000} found form process data, that the overall heat transfer coefficient ($\alpha A$)
        can be approximated by a simple formula in terms of the condenser inlet vapour flowrate
        \Eq{}{
            \alpha A = c_1 \left( V_{con}^{in} \right)^{0.8}.
        }
