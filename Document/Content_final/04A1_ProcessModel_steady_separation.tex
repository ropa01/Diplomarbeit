    The separation step within the process occurs within a double effect distillation column.
    Distillation columns are among the most widely studied pieces of process equipment. While much has been
    accomplished, the robust simulation poses great challenges to this day. In the context of cryogenic
    air separation the associated mixture displays only moderate non-idealities and furthermore is
    a zeotropic one. The main complexity however is due to the strong interdependencies of the different
    columns arising from thermal and material coupling within the process.

    In this section first the mathematical formulation for a general steady-state distillation column model,
    which has been developed as a multi-purpose, easily applicable model for the process simulator \gproms,
    will be presented (\secref{sec:mathpro:steady:distmodel}). As one of the specialties of the ASU process,
    an integrated condenser and reboiler unit is employed. Especially for the dynamic case, explicitly
    considering this fact  this can be used for model simplifications. In order to have an equivalent set of
    models, a steady-state version is presented here as well (\secref{sec:mathpro:steady:conreb}).

    \subsubsection{Distillation column model}
    \label{sec:mathpro:steady:distmodel}

        The core equations describing the operation of any distillation column, or more general vapour liquid contacting
        device, are often referred to as the MESH equations \cite{Kister.1992}. The acronym
        MESH stands for material, equilibrium, summation and enthalpy (often represented by the symbol $H$). These equations, although
        rather plain at first glimpse, form a set of highly non-linear, highly coupled equations. The solutions of which
        poses a non-trivial task for current solution algorithms, whose success is highly dependent on the quality of
        initial estimates for the involved variables. Therefore a strategy used for the automated generation of such
        guesses will be described as well.

        The model presented here is not only to be used for the simulation of a given process, but rather
        for optimization purposes as well. While several of the decision variables associated
        with the  process can be optimized from a generic set of equations, others need further consideration.
        The optimization decisions which add the greatest complexity for distillation columns are the locations for feeds
        and side draws, as well the number of trays for a given separation task. Part of the added complexity is
        the introduction of integer decisions into the model and and the associated need for a super structure which
        includes all process alternatives to be considered.

        The starting point for the model development is a single separation stage within the
        column with all possible material and energy streams entering and leaving the stage. \Figref{fig:col_super}
        shows the superstructure to be used for the complete column, while \figref{fig:col_stage_super} shows a super
        structure for a single separation stage.

        If not stated otherwise, all equations presented in this section apply to all separation stages. In order
        to improve readability the indices denoting a stage are sometimes omitted, if not essential for the meaning of
        a given equation. throughout the description of the models and the thesis the number of stages in a column section
        will be denoted by $n_S$, while $n_C$, $n_F$, $n_{SV}$ and $n_{SL}$ represent the total number of components,
        feeds, vapour and liquid side draws respectively.

        \ncr{z^L_{ij}}{feed mole fraction to stage $j$}{-}
        A certain amount of the liquid or vapour leaving a stage can be withdrawn from the column by means
        of the vapour $S^V_j$ and liquid $S^L_j$ side draw streams. During model development it was observed, that
        when a specification was made on given side-draw, convergence was sometimes hindered. This behaviour
        could be improved by specifying a dimensionless side-draw,
        %
        \Eq{eq:val:vap:strip}{
            s_j^V = \frac{S_j^V}{V_j}, \eqanns, \\
            s_j^L = \frac{S_j^L}{V_j}, \eqanns,
        }%
        \ncr{s^V_j}{dimensionless vapour side-draw from stage $j$}{-}
        \ncr{s^L_j}{dimensionless liquid side-draw from stage $j$}{-}
        %
        rather than an actual stream. It should be noted, that this technically introduces further non-linearities
        into the material balances. As it is difficult, to guess the dimensionless side draw
        for a desired side draw flowrate, the specification can be replaced by a specification
        on the flowrate, once model initialization has been achieved.

        By considering these dimensionless side-draws the material balance can be rewritten as
        \Eqml{eq:col:CompBalance}{
    		0 = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot y_{i,j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)
                \cdot L_j \cdot x_{i,j} - V_{j+1} \cdot y_{i,j+1} - L_{j-1} \cdot x_{i,j-1}
                - F_j \cdot z_{i,j}, \\ \eqanncs.
    	}%
        %
        As the model is also to be used for optimization of structural decisions, further extensions are necessary.
        To accommodate that need, new variables are introduced. Particularly split variables $\zeta$ as employed
        by \cite{Dunnebier.1999} are introduced for feeds, vapour and liquid side draws and the reflux location.
        As the feeds are and side draws are to be fed or taken from a single stage, the split variables must assume
        integer values of either one or zero. Furthermore those decisions are \emph{exclusive or} type decisions, hence
        \Eq{eq:col:feedsplit}{
            1 =  \sum \zeta.
        }%

        In order to optimize the number of stages several superstructures are possible. One can
        optimize the reboiler reflux location and condenser reflux location or each single one
        along with the feed and side draw locations. The number of stages is then changed as all stages
        between condenser or reboiler reflux are effectively rendered inactive. The solution of
        the mass and energy balances for each inactive stage becomes trivial as only one single
        vapour or liquid stream enters and exits the stage.

        While the choice if condenser and / or reboiler
        reflux is optimized is somewhat arbitrary, some studies have shown \cite{Grossmann.2005} that
        the strategy of optimizing only feed location and reboiler reflux location possesses some
        numerical advantages in terms of performance of the solution algorithm. However this observation
        might be specific to the particular solver used. Furthermore, as will be seen later, there are
        certain situations where optimizing either reboiler or condenser reflux is beneficial in terms of
        problem formulation. The developed model therefore offers capabilities to choose, whether the top
        or bottom reflux is variable. Either reflux will be represented by the generic variable $R$.

        With the newly introduced split variables for the feed $\zeta^F_{ij}$
        as well as the reboiler reflux $\zeta^R_j$ and the liquid $\zeta^{SL}_{ij}$ and vapour $\zeta^{SV}_{ij}$
        side draws, the material balances can be written as
        \Eqml{eq:col:CompBalance_opt}{
    		0 = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot y_{i,j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)
                \cdot L_j \cdot x_{i,j} - V_{j+1} \cdot y_{i,j+1} \\ \hfill - L_{j-1} \cdot x_{i,j-1}
                - \sum_{k=1}^{n_F} \zeta^F_{kj} \cdot F_j \cdot z_{i,j} - \zeta^R_j \cdot R \cdot z_{R}, \hfill%
                \\ \eqannote{i = 1 \dots C, \quad j = 1 \dots n_S, \quad k = 1 \dots n_F}.

        \ncg{\zeta^{R}_{j}}{splitting variable for reflux on stage $j$}{-}
        %
        Furthermore to be able to optimize side draws, the stripping factors have to be reformulated
        accordingly
        \Eq{eq:val:vap:strip_opt}{
            s_j^V = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{SV}} \zeta^{SV}_{ij} S_j^V}{V_j}, \eqannote{j = 1 \dots n_S, \quad i = 1 \dots n_{SV}},
        }%
        \Eq{eq:val:liq:strip_opt}{
            s_j^L = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{SL}} \zeta^{SL}_{ij} S_j^L}{L_j}, \eqannote{j = 1 \dots n_S, \quad i = 1 \dots n_{SL}}.
        }%
        %
        \paragraph{Equilibrium} between a vapour and liquid is achieved when the chemical potentials for each
        component in both pases are equal. This is commonly expressed by a equilibrium constant ($K_i$). With
        that the equilibrium equation can be written as
        \Eq{eq:col:Kxy}{
            y_{i}^{eq} = K_{i} \cdot x_{i}, \eqannc.
    	}%
        \ncr{K_{ij}}{equilibrium constant of component $i$ on stage $j$}{-}
        \ncr{y_{i}^{eq}}{equilibrium vapour concentration of component $i$ on stage $j$}{\frac{mol}{mol}}
        %
        The requirement for equal chemical potentials can be expressed in terms of the vapour $f_i^V$
        and liquid $f_i^L$ fugacities \cite{AndreasPfennig.2003}.
        \Eq{eq:col:fug}{
            f_i^V = f_i^L, \eqannc.
    	}%
        \ncr{f_i^V}{vapour fugacity}{-}
        \ncr{f_i^L}{liquid fugacity}{-}
        %
        These fugacities are calculated from the liquid activity coefficients $\gamma_i$,
        the pointing factor $F_{Pi}$, the reference vapour fugacity coefficient $\varphi_i$,
        the component saturation pressure $p^S_i$ as well as the system pressure $p$ along
        with the vapour and liquid molar fractions
        \Eq{eq:col:fug_ext}{
            \gamma_i \, F_{Pi} \, \varphi^0_i \, p^S_i \, x_i = \varphi_i \, p \, y_i, \eqannc.
    	}%

        \ncr{p}{system pressure}{Pa}
        \ncr{F_{Pi}}{compressibility factor of component $i$}{-}
        %
        After simple rearrangement \eqref{eq:col:fug_ext} an expression for the equilibrium ratios
        can be derived
        \Eq{eq:col:fug_ext}{
            y_i^{eq} = \underbrace{\frac{\gamma_i \, F_{Pi} \, \varphi^0_i \, p^S_i}{\varphi_i \, p}}_{K_i}
                x_i, \eqannc.
    	}%
        %
        The equations to determine the quantities used when computing the equilibrium ratios are by
        themselves functions of temperature, pressure, and vapour as well as liquid molar fractions.
        They are further discussed in \secref{sec:mathpro:thermo}. It therefore becomes evident that the
        equilibrium ratios are a major source for the non-linearities in the presented model.

        When simulating a distillation process one might consider only equilibrium stages. This however
        will in most cases not reflect the true behaviour of a real stage as the time a vapour and
        liquid phase are in contact might not suffice to achieve equilibrium conditions. This can be
        accounted for by introduction of Murphee tray efficiencies \cite{Henley.op.2011}
        \Eq{eq:ss:murphee}{
            \eta^{eq}_{ij} = \frac{y_{ij} - y_{ij+1}}{y_{ij}^{eq} - y_{ij+1}}, \eqanncs.
        }
        %
        While several models to approximate these efficiencies have been investigated, their predictions are
        most often rather poor \cite{Coulson.1999} and their evaluation rather complex. Furthermore as indicated
        in the formula they might differ for different species involved. For this model however
        they are not computed separately, but rather supplied and assumed constant for all stages and components.

        \paragraph{Enthalpy balances} are again written considering the previously defined stripping factors
        and splitting variables
    	\Eqml{eq:col:EnergyBalance}{
    		0 = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot h^V_{j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)

        \ncr{H^{R}}{reflux enthalpy stream}{\molenth}
        %
        \paragraph{Condenser and reboiler} are modeled more or less as regular column stages. However
        they possess certain specialties that are explicitly considered in the column model. For one it is assumed
        that no feeds enter the condenser stage. Furthermore no vapour side stream is drawn from the condenser as well as
        no liquid side stream from the reboiler.

        \begin{figure}

        \end{figure}

        Additionally the condenser stage needs to examined a little further. In terms of operations
        several assumptions can be made for the condenser. In general one can distinguish a total,
        partial vapour and partial vapour liquid condenser. For the total condenser all vapour that
        enters the respective stage is condensed and only liquid product is drawn. The partial vapour
        condenser condenses only the vapour the which is to be fed back into
        the column and all product that is drawn is gaseous. The partial vapour liquid condenser
        denotes the most general case, where part of the incoming vapour is condensed and product
        is drawn from the vapour and liquid phase. The most important thing to consider in these
        different cases is, that while in both partial condensers a vapour liquid equilibrium takes
        place. Due to the absence of vapour the same does not hold for the total condenser. To accommodate
        that fact the MESH equations have to be adjusted \cite{Naphtali.1971}. While the material and energy
        balances remain unchanged the equilibrium equations have to be altered. First the vapour and
        liquid compositions are set equal for all but one component
        \Eq{eq:col:total}{
            x_{i1} = y_{i1} \eqannote{i = 1 \dots C-1},
        }%
        and the condenser temperature is determined by the bubble point equation
        \Eq{eq:col:bub}{
            1 = \sum_i K_{i1}(T_1, p_1,x_1,y_1) \cdot x_{i1} \eqannc.
        }%
        %
        When implementing the model in a process simulator it is sensible to consider, that due to
        the limited accuracy of computers the omitted component in \eqref{eq:col:total} needs to be
        a non-trace component in the condenser stage. The implemented model therefore has to specify
        such a component when a total condenser is chosen to avoid numerical difficulties.

        In practice it is highly unlikely, that the exact amount of energy required to condensate all
        liquid will be drawn from the condenser. More likely, if all vapour is condensed, slightly more
        energy will be withdrawn and sub-cooled liquid will leave the condenser. Therefore
        the model includes the possibility to specify a degree of sub-cooling $T^{sub}$ which will be
        considered when calculating bubble point temperature
        %
        \Eq{eq:col:bub}{
            1 = \sum_i K_{i1}(T_1 + T^{sub}, p_1,x_1,y_1) \cdot x_{i1} \eqannc.
        }%
        \ncr{T^{sub}}{sub-cooling temperature}{K}
        %
        \paragraph{Pressure} along the entire column is often specified in the steady-state case.
        However as it is inconvenient and unpractical to specify a pressure for each stage one might either specify
        a pressure at the top and bottom stage and assume a uniform pressure profile along the column, or
        specify either top $p_1$ or bottom pressure $p_N$ along with a total pressure drop $\Delta p$,
        or a stage-wise one $\Delta p_{stage}$. However the issue is further complicated if one considers the
        case of optimization for number of trays. In that case several trays will become inactive. For those
        trays the mass and energy balances become trivial, as only liquid enters and exits these trays.
        (For the case employed here, where the reboiler reflux is being optimized). This also means,
        that from the last active tray down to the reboiler -- if present -- there should be a uniform
        profile. It is important to note, that if a uniform pressure profile from the lowest active stage
        downward is not enforced, the solver will have to compensate for slight changes in the equilibrium
        due to pressure variations with minimal vapour flow-rates. This is very undesirable, as it might
        lead to severe problems in the solver, or the calculation of other properties, dependent on these values.
        To account for this issue, the reboiler reflux split be employed to deactivate the pressure drop
        \Eq{}{
            p_i = p_{j-1} + \left(1 - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \zeta^R_k \right) \cdot \Delta p_{j-1} \eqanns.
        }
        \ncr{\Delta p}{pressure drop over entire column}{Pa}
        \ncr{\Delta p_{stage}}{stage-wise pressure drop}{Pa}
        %
        As an alternative to specifying the pressure, one might consider calculating the pressure drop
        form (semi)-empirical models. There a numerous correlations for different types of column internals.
        These correlations become particularly important if column dynamics are to be considered, as they
        form the connection between holdups and flow-rates within the column. Two different pressure drop models
        have been implemented, one for trayed columns and another one for structured packings. As they are closely
        tied to dynamics, they will be discussed in more detail in \secref{sec:mathpro:dynamic}.


    \subsubsection{Integrated condenser \& reboiler}
    \label{sec:mathpro:steady:conreb}
        \begin{figure}
            \center
            \input{Pictures/condenser_reboiler}
            \caption{Integrated condenser \& reboiler unit.}
            \label{fig:mathpro:conreb_ss}
        \end{figure}

        The integrated condenser reboiler unit is a peculiarity of the ASU process. The fact that condenser and
        reboiler are linked form the close coupling between both sections of the double effect column.
        This stems from the fact, that each change in the parameters and operation of this unit will reverberate
        through the entire process, as they will simultaneously affect boil-up ratio and reflux
        ratio of the column, both major operational parameters with great effect.

        Therefore a separate model for this unit was developed, rather that simply establishing a couple between the
        the condenser and the reboiler in the case for two separately modeled column sections.

        The reboiler side is modeled much like an equilibrium stage in the column, considering the entering
        and leaving streams as depicted in \figref{sec:mathpro:steady:conreb}. However in contrast to the
        equations supplied for a column section, no integer optimization terms will have to be considered.
        Furthermore no side draws, or separate feeds are recognized. With that the material balances are
        \Eq{}{
            0 = L_{reb}^{in} x_{i,reb}^{in} - L_{reb}^{out} x_{i}^{reb} - V_{reb}^{out} y_{i}^{reb}, \eqannc.
        }
        The energy balance taking into account the transferred energy ($Q_{CR}$) becomes therefore
        \Eq{}{
            0 = L_{reb}^{in} h_{reb}^{in} - L_{reb}^{out} h^L_{reb} - V_{reb}^{out} h^V_{reb} + Q_{CR}.
        }
        The equilibrium and summation equations are analogous to the ones presented for the column model.
        A pressure drop again is assigned with relation to the lowest column stage.

        The condenser is modeled as a total condenser. The mass and component balances therefore become trivial
        \Eq{}{
            x_{i,con} & = y_{i,con}^{in}, \eqannc, \\
            V_{con}^{in} & = L_{con}^{out}.
        }
        The temperature is set to the bubble temperature of the given mixture at an assigned pressure. The
        enthalpies of the entering and leaving stream can therefore be calculated from the given EOS. And
        the energy balance determines the transferred energy
        \Eq{}{
            0 = V_{con}^{in} h_{con}^{in} - L_{con}^{out} h^L_{con} - Q_{CR}.
        }
