    This chapter will illustrate different process units and their mathematical representation.
    As depicted in \figref{fig:asu_simple} three of the major tasks within the cryogenic air separation process will 
    be regarded, when formulating the process.
    These are the compression of ambient air, heat exchange with product streams and the separation of streams.
    While those different stages are highly interdependent they will be discussed separately and mathematical
    models for the various process units contained in each stage will be presented.

    The first section (\secref{sec:mathpro:steady}) deals with a steady state version of the process model. Especially
    for steady state models the issue of initializing the variables in such a way that the solver can converge to a solution
    becomes crucial. With that in mind the strategies developed to initialize in particular the distillation columns will also
    be elaborated upon.
    The second section (\secref{sec:mathpro:dynamic}) is devoted to a dynamic version of the models for some process units.
    In addition to the models themselves several aspects which arise when considering process dynamics, will also be part
    of that section.
    The models used to determine thermodynamic properties of process streams are briefly introduced in \secref{sec:mathpro:thermo}. 
    However these equations were not manually implemented are available from external routines through a foreign object 
    interface within \gproms. 
    All other presented models have been implemented in the equation based process simulator. Certain aspects arising when
    implementing the models will be discussed in the last section of this chapter \secref{sec:mathpro:implementation}.
