Most continuous processes are designed to operate at steady-state. If so, no temporal gradients are present during
process operations. A detailed knowledge about steady-state process behaviour is therefore essential to designing 
processes at a certain operating point. 

In this section several models required for simulating the ASU process at steady-state operations are presented. 
All major tasks highlighted in \figref{fig:asu_simple} will be considered here.
