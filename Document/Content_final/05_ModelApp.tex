\chapter{Process model application}
\label{chp:processmodelapp}
The desired outcome of implementing process models is to be able to predict process behaviour 
such that a lot of experiments can be replaced by simulation runs. Beyond simulating a process, 
it is also possible to optimize process design and operation. In this section the 
previously discussed models are applied in various ways to gain insight into the
aforementioned example process (\secref{chp:airsep}).

The following chapter is structured as follows. Initially some theoretical considerations 
as to how the examined class of problems, namely discrete-continuous, can be solved. 
This is followed by the description of several applications for the steady-state and dynamic models.
As for the implementation, several things have to be considered, when applying these models. 
Some intricacies of model implementation and application are discussed in the last section.
