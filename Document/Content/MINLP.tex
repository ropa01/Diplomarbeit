\chapter{Mixed-integer optimization}
\label{chp:MINLP}
In this section some general considerations about mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) will be presented. 
First the most commonly applied solution techniques will briefly be discussed on the basis of a review on the 
subject by Grossmann \cite{Grossmann.2002}. Then then an alternative approach to solve this class of problems,  
based on a continuous reformulation of the discrete decision variables, which has recently been proposed
\cite{Kraemer.2010,Stein.2004} will also be introduced. This reformulation is also the basis for a comparison of different 
approaches to solve this class of problem within the process simulation environment \gproms.  

    \section{solution techniques}

    As previously stated, the following discussion of general solution techniques for MINLP's is largely based 
    in the comprehensive review by I. E. Grossmann \cite{Grossmann.2002}. 
    
    Several approaches to tackle this type of problem have successfully been applied to a multitude of cases for 
    several years now. In general four major types of solution algorithms can be distinguished.  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item branch and bound
        \item outer approximation
        \item generalized benders
        \item extended cutting plane
    \end{itemize}
    All these algorithms make use of a limited number of common subproblems, which are then solved 
    in different configurations. Therefore these subproblems can previously be discussed.  

    The general case of a MINLP takes the form:
    \program{prog:stdMINLP}{
        & \minimize{x,y} & & C = f(x,y) \\
        & \st & & g_j(x,y) \leq 0, \; \; j \in \mathbf{J} \\
        & & & x \in \mathbf{X}, \; y \in \mathbf{Y}
    }
    
    The relaxed subproblem 
    \program{prog:relaxedNLP}{
        & \minimize{x,y} & & C_{LB}^k = f(x,y) \\
        & \st & & g_j(x,y) \leq 0, \; \; j \in \mathbf{J} \\
        & & & x \in \mathbf{X}, \; \; y \in \mathbf{Y}_R \\
        & & & y_i \leq \alpha_i^k, \; i \in \mathbf{I}_{FL}^k \\
        & & & y_i \geq \beta_i^k, \; i \in \mathbf{I}_{FU}^k
    }
    
    NLP subproblem for fixed $y^k$
    \program{prog:fixedyNLP}{
        & \minimize{x} & & C_{LB}^k = f(x,y^k) \\
        & \st & & g_j(x,y^k) \leq 0, \; \; j \in \mathbf{J} \\
        & & & x \in \mathbf{X}
    }
    
    NLP feasibility subproblem for fixed $y^k$
    \program{}{
        & \minimize{x} & & u \\
        & \st & & g_j(x,y^k) \leq u, \; \; j \in \mathbf{J} \\
        & & & x \in \mathbf{X}, \; \; u \in \mathbf{R}^1
    }
