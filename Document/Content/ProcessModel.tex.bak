%        A simplified overview of the major process steps is given in \figref{fig:asu_simple}.
%    Within the following sections the different process steps will be discussed in more detail.
%    When appropriate the mathematical model for single process units is discussed as well.
%    In addition to the separate process steps displayed in \figref{fig:asu_simple} the aspect
%    of heat integration os essential to successfully operating an air separation unit (ASU).
%    This aspect will be discussed separately as well (\secref{sec:heat_exchange})
%
%    The pre-purification step of the process aim to reduce the amount of unwanted impurities
%    from the ambient air as far as possible. The main sources of contamination are in this case
%    dust and other organic components that can be found depending on the time of year and
%    location of the plant. Furthermore are water and carbon dioxide common components in
%    ambient air. The removal of these components is undertaken by means of adsorption molecular
%    sieves such as zeolite or for initial steps coarser sieves. However the design and simulation
%    of these pre-purification measures is not within the scope of this work. For more information
%    the interested reader is referred to \cite{Acharya.1996}.


    This chapter deals with the different aspects of the process model developed within the scope of this thesis. 
    As depicted in \figref{fig:asu_simple} In the case of cryogenic air separation three main tasks for the process 
    can be identified. These are the compression of raw materials, heat exchange with product streams and the separation 
    of air. While those different stages are highly interdependent they will be discussed separately and mathematical 
    models for the main process units will be presented. 
    
    The first section (\secref{sec:mathpro:steady}) deals with a steady state version of the process model. Especially 
    for steady state models the issue of initializing the variables in such a way that the solver can converge to a solution 
    becomes crucial. With that in mind the strategies developed to initialize in particular the distillation columns will be 
    elaborated upon within that first section as well. 
    
    The second section (\secref{sec:mathpro:dynamic}) is devoted to a dynamic version of the models for some process units. 
    In addition to the models themselves several aspects which arise, when considering process dynamics will also be part 
    of that section. 
    
    In the third section (\secref{sec:mathpro:econ}) of this chapter takes a closer look at how the economics of the process can be captured during 
    process simulation. Understandably, the issue of economic evaluation is closely tied to the sizing of each process 
    unit and with that also to the operational boundaries of the process equipment. As these aspects are for the most 
    part treated uniformly for the steady state case and dynamic case the will be dealt with in a single section. 
    
    All presented models have been implemented in the equation based process simulator \gproms. Certain aspects arising when  
    implementing the models will be discussed in the last section of this chapter \secref{sec:mathpro:implementation}.

    \section{Thermodynamic models}
        \label{sec:mathpro:thermo}
        
        Aside from the unit operation models, the behaviour of materials in a process needs to be adequately
        accounted for. This is done by means of so called equations of state (EOS) and excess Gibbs energy
        models. In terms of thermodynamics there are only a limited amount of variables. Namely the pressure,
        density and temperature as well as composition. While equations of state can model a given system in
        the vapour as well as liquid phase, excess Gibbs energy models only account for the behaviour of a liquid
        and need to be used in conjunction with other models for the vapour phase. However they have shown
        considerable better performance for highly non-ideal systems \cite{AndreasPfennig.2003}. As mentioned
        earlier (\secref{sec:comp_liq}) it is essential to accurately capture the non-idealities of air
        in order to capture the liquefaction process. In the case of cryogenic air separation, the Peng-Robinson
        as well as the Benders equation of state have shown satisfactory performance. The Peng-Robinson equation
        was chosen to be used in the presented model
        \Eq{eq:peng_rob}{
            p & = \frac{RT}{V-b} - \frac{a_c \left[1+m\left(1-\sqrt{T_r}\right)\right]^2}{V^2+2bV-b^2} \\
            m & = 0.37464 + 1.54226 \omega - 0.26992 \omega^2 \\
            a_c & = 0.45724 \frac{R^2T_c^2}{p_c} \\
            b & = 0.077796 \frac{RT_c}{p_c} \\
            \omega & = -1 - \log_{10} \, (p_r^{sat})_{T_r = 0.7}
        }
        \ncr{p}{pressure}{Pa}
        \ncr{m}{parameter in Peng-Robinson EOS}{-}
        \ncr{a_c}{parameter in Peng-Robinson EOS}{\frac{m^5}{mol^2 s^2}}
        \ncr{b}{parameter in Peng-Robinson EOS}{\frac{m^3}{mol}}
        
        However the Peng-Robinson EOS relies on the so called one-fluid theory which models each fluid as pure.
        To model mixtures the pure component parameters have to be ''mixed''
        \Eq{}{
            a & = \sum_{i=1}^C \sum_{j=1}^C y_i y_j a_{ij}, \\
            a_{ij} & = \sqrt{a_i a_j} (1 - k_{ij}), \\
            b & = \sum_{i=1}^C y_i b_i.
        }
    
        From that EOS numerous relevant properties such as excess enthalpy, fugacity coefficients or densities
        can be calculated. For a list of some relevant equations refer to \secref{app:peng_rob_deriv}.
