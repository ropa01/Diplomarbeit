The separation of air finds many application in the modern industry. Pure oxygen and nitrogen are
are essential for many processes. The yearly amount of oxygen extracted from air exceeds 100 million 
tonnes and nitrogen even surpassing these numbers\cite{Emsley.2003c2001}. Among the most prominent 
examples is the production of synthesis gas,
which forms the basis for a multitude of very large scale process operations. In addition the
air separation processes find application as a utility provider rather than producer of producer
for example in highly efficient integrated combustion cycles \cite{Mahapatra.2010}. Due to the
many different applications, pure nitrogen or oxygen is needed with various demands on
purity, flow rate or phase composition. Therefore different technologies are suitable to specific tasks.

In general three main principles of air separation can be identified; adsorption,
cryogenic distillation and transport through membranes. \Figref{fig:tech_compar} illustrates the 
economically most viable processes depending on product stream volume and purity.
In the further course of this chapter the most prevalent  air separation technologies
along with their main fields of application and economic scope are introduced.

    \section{Cryogenic processes}
    \label{sec:cryo_air_sep}
    \begin{figure}

        \label{fig:ASU}
    \end{figure}
    Cryogenic air separation processes are implemented over a great variety of industries among others refining,
    petrochemicals, medical, food \& beverages and environmental \cite{Sirdeshpande.2005}. \Figref{fig:ASU}
    shows the major unit operations associated with the process. Initially the air is compressed and later re-expanded
    to reach the low temperatures required for liquefaction. In an intermediate pre-treatment step most unwanted
    contaminants are removed. Particularly the amount of carbon dioxide in the gas carries great significance, as
    operating conditions lie beneath its freezing point. Due to freeze out at those low temperatures, especially
    within the heat exchanger the performance of process units can greatly be reduced, or entirely hindered.
    The pre-treated air is then cooled against product streams leaving the separation stage of the process. To which extend
    the refrigeration is  recovered is among the most dominant factors for economic operations. The requirements
    towards the product streams determine how much can be recovered. Most processes produce gaseous streams at
    approximately ambient pressure and temperature \cite{Smith.2001} and hence recover the maximum of energy from the
    process. However often a subsequent compression step or even liquefaction step is employed to deliver the
    desired product to the consumer.

    In terms of economically feasible operations, the compression denotes a sizable contribution to the capital cost
    and is responsible for the majority of the operating cost. However when recovering liquid product, the
    compression work needs to increase in order to compensate for the loss in recoverable refrigeration. Due to the widespread
    application of the  process, several increasingly complex process configurations are being implemented
    with different strategies, for internal recovery of pressure energy and refrigeration.

    The cryogenic process can most economically simultaneously produce large quantities of highly pure oxygen and nitrogen.
    In addition argon and other noble gases can be recovered from the process. Most alternative technologies will
    produce one single product stream. Additionally can the economy of scale be largely exploited for this
    process, which is why current developments are towards large scale single train that can produce
    an excess of several thousand tonnes of product stream per day \cite{Castle.2002}.

    \section{Adsorption processes}
    \label{sec:psa}
    Certain materials display a higher affinity to adsorb a specific class of molecules. Nitrogen is
    more easily adsorbed in zeolithes than oxygen. Therefore if air is fed through a
    zeolithe bed, an oxygen rich stream is produced. Since any bed will eventually
    be saturated and its capability for adsorption be exhausted, the process carries an
    inherent discontinuity. However, for most processes which yield large product streams,
    continuous operations are more cost effective.

    To realize a continuous process multiple adsorption vessels are operated simultaneously.
    Once a bed is saturated, the process is switched to a different vessel and the saturated one
    is regenerated. Regeneration utilizes the change of adsorption capabilities at varying temperature
    or pressure. By increasing temperature or lowering pressure can the bed therefore be regenerated.
    Due to the switching during operations these processes a commonly known as temperature swing adsorption
    (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA). For most industrial applications PSA is preferred for its
    simpler operation and faster cycle times \cite{Smith.2001}.

    The ability to construct very compact units, have led to implementations of PSA processes at
    very different scales. Briefcase sized units are constructed for treatment of asthma patients or other
    medical appliances. Larger scale plants have successfully been utilized, for example in the paper industry
    during the de-lignation of pulp \cite{Nelson.1993}.

    The bed size is the determining factor for equipment cost. Since cycle times are limited by the regeneration
    step, the bed size and therefore the cost increases rapidly with the product flowrate. For very large
    scale operations the cryogenic process is more economically viable. However the process can be operated
    much more flexible due to drastically shorter start-up times compared to the cryogenic process. Furthermore, no
    by-products can be recovered from the process without further subsequent separations \cite{Choi.2003}.

    	\label{fig:PSA}
    \end{figure}

    \Figref{fig:PSA} shows a simple flowsheet of a PSA process. For continuous operations two separate beds would
    suffice, however, to expedite cycle times and process throughput as well as exploit possibilities for pressure
    energy recovery, process configurations with three or more beds are often installed. Variations of the process
    use sub-atmospheric pressures during the regeneration step. Such processes are commonly referred to as vacuum swing
    adsorption (VSA).

    \section{Membrane processes}
    \label{sec:membrane}
    In case of the membrane process, the type of membrane used leads to very different process characteristics. For the
    production of oxygen either polymeric membranes (PEM) or ion-transport membranes (ITM) are installed.

     \begin{figure}
    	\center
    	\input{pgfplots/GasPermeation}
	    \caption{Membrane unit for gas permeation.}
    	\label{fig:gas_permeation}
    \end{figure}

    Polymeric membranes operate at near ambient conditions. The driving force for separation is the difference
    diffusion rates through the membrane \cite{Melin.2007}. The product flowrate and selectivity are the
    determining factors for capital cost. These are mainly dependent on the membrane area. Hence
    the capital cost for the process is expected to rise somewhat linear with the product flowrate.
    The process can economically generate a medium process stream ($\approx 20 \; t/d$) at lower purities.
    The minimal start-up time and operations near ambient conditions make the process ideal for
    applications where oxygen enriched process streams suffice and contaminants such as water or carbon
    dioxide can be tolerated. Membranes which incorporate active species that facilitate oxygen transport
    trough the membrane bear the potential to greatly improve process performance \cite{Kammermeyer.1976}.
    In general are the alternative technologies more mature than membrane processes.

    Processes with ion exchange membranes are drastically different from the ones with PEM's. Foremost they
    operate at high temperatures ($\approx 900 K$). At the membrane surface oxygen molecules are ionized
    and transported through the membrane along an externally applied electric potential. They travel
    through the membrane at very high flow rates. The process is capable of producing virtually pure
    oxygen. It is especially suited for integration with power generation processes \cite{Smith.2001}.

    \section{Hybrid processes}
    The three different alternatives presented before constitute the major technologies for separations
    of gases and therefore the production of pure nitrogen and oxygen. All technologies have their specific
    advantages and disadvantages. As the separation of gases remains a major issue when facing upcoming challenges
    for our industries substantial efforts are being made to improve current processes in terms of ecological
    and economic performance. A very promising way to achieve such improvements is to combine these technologies
    to form hybrid processes. Membranes offer many favourable characteristics are subject to limitations when
    it comes to large flow-rates and high purities. When lower purities are required or the flow-rates are limited
    they offer an efficient and cost effective way for gas separation. Therefore in the past years several
    alternatives for PSA - membrane \cite{Akinlabi.2007} or membrane-cryogenic distillation processes \cite{Wankat.2011}
    have been studied. The membrane can function within the process either as a pretreatment step, where a product enriched
    stream at medium purities and high flow-rates is produced, or after the main separation, when the main
    by-products are already removed, as a last stage to reach very high purities.
