\chapter{Process optimization}
\label{chp:optimization}
Process optimization bears great potential for designing ecologically and economically optimal processes.
Within this chapter first some basic concepts of constrained optimization are summarized as this proves
useful for the remainder of the chapter. The problems arising when optimizing chemical processes involve
both continuous and discrete decisions. In order to solve this class of so called mixed-integer non-linear
problems (MINLP) designated algorithms have to be employed to accommodate the special nature of the integer
variables. The major approaches used today to solve this class of program  are summarized in the second section.
Lastly these approaches be applied to several problems in the context of optimizing the cryogenic air separation
process.
