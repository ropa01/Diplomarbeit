There are several ways besides cryogenic air separation that can be employed to separate gas mixtures.
In this chapter different competing technologies and their main applications will be discussed. The
predominately used technologies are cryogenic distillation, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) as well as
gas permeation (GP). In the distillation process the gas is first liquefied. Separation is the achieved
by the different concentration differences in vapor and liquid phase. PSA relies on the different affinities
of gaseous species to adsorb to certain materials in order to extract a component form a mixture. During gas
permeation membranes are used. Each species migrates in different quantities through a given membrane
depending on process parameters and membrane structure.

\reffig{fig:tech_compar} illustrates the most economically viable processes depending on product
purity and product stream volume. It can be seen that alternative air separation processes
cannot supply the high quality or quantity of the cryogenic process. Due to that cryogenic air separation is
thought to be the main supplier of highly pure gases in industrial quantities for years to come
\cite{Castle.2002}.
The alternative processes however offer some very appealing characteristics, which make them the
favorable choice when lower quantities of product or more moderate purity is required. The cryogenic
process is always connected with an considerable energy consumption for the liquefaction and compression.
Due to that smaller implementations of the process a very unlikely to yield economically sound solutions
to a separation problem.

\section{Cryogenic air separation}
\label{sec:cryo_air_sep}
Cryogenic Air Separation finds applications over a great variety of industries among others refining, petrochemicals, medical, food \& beverages and environmental \cite{Sirdeshpande.2005}. Furthermore
prospective processes for power generation from fossil sources in form of the integrated gaseous combined
cycle (IGCC) integrates the air separation process in order to enable more environmentally friendly power
generation \cite{Mahapatra.2010}.

As can be seen in \reffig{fig:ASU} double effect heat integrated distillation column lies at the heart of the air
liquefaction processes. It consists of a high pressure column (HPC) operating at 0.68 $MPa$ and
temperatures below 130 $K$ as well as a low pressure column (LPC) which operates at around 0.13
$MPa$ an comparable temperatures. In order to also attain highly pure argon as a product the process
may also include a crude argon column (CAC) which works at slightly lower pressures than the LPC.

The plant air entering the process is initially purified, where carbon and nitrogen oxides as well as solid contaminants are removed, and then compressed to process conditions. The compressed air is then cooled
against product streams namely liquefied nitrogen, oxygen and argon. The air stream is then divided into
several sub-streams. One of those is fed into the HPC bottom, while another is expanded by means of a
turbine and further cooled down through the Joule- Thompson effect. Aside from further cooling energy from
the initial compression is thus partially recovered. This expanded air stream is then fed into the LPC. At the
bottom of the LPC liquid as well as gaseous oxygen are recovered as desired products. The bottom and top
streams from the HPC are made up of an oxygen rich liquid as well as liquid nitrogen. The liquid nitrogen
stream is led though an heat exchanger an the fed as reflux into the top of the LPC. The bottom stream is,
after heat integration, partially fed into the LPC as well as CAC. From the lower part of the LPC a side stream
is drawn and led into the bottom of the CAC. At the same point the reflux from the CAC is fed back into the
LPC \cite{Zhu.2010}.

\section{Pressure swing adsorption}
\label{sec:psa}

Pressure Swing Adsorption has been employed to separate gaseous mixtures for some time. During the
80's and 90's commercial applications for the production of oxygen or nitrogen have gained more and
more attention. Especially the ability to construct very compact units the size of a briefcase, have led to
the implementation  of PSA processes for treatment of asthma patients or other medical appliances. But
also larger scale plants have successfully been utilized, for example in the paper industry during the
de-lignation of pulp. It remains true however, that for large scale industrial settings with high product
quality demands, cryogenic separation remains the most viable alternative.

Separation is achieved during the PSA process by adsorption of one component in the mixture to a given
bed. Once the bed is saturated with a the adsorbing species, it has to be regenerated in order to continue
production. The ability to adsorb a certain species is dependent on the system pressure. At higher pressures
more gas can be adsorbed then at lower pressures. Thus by reducing the pressure in the reaction vessel,
the Adsorbent can be regenerated.

\end{figure}

In order to avoid non-continuous processes, two or more reaction vessels are employed. Therefore the
saturated vessel can be regenerated, while the other one continues production. By alternating adsorption
and regenerating in the different vessels continuous production can be achieved. A schematic for a simple
two bed cycle is shown in \reffig{fig:PSA}. Ambient air is first led through the first reaction vessel at the
elevated pressure. Within the vessel nitrogen is adsorbed until saturation is reached. At that point the
ambient air is led through the second vessel. A fraction of the product stream is fed into the first vessel and
used as sweep for the regeneration of the adsorbent at lower pressure.

Depending on the size of the process two different pressure level are used. One cycle adsorbs the nitrogen
at a pressure of approximately  7.5 bar while regeneration is done at ambient pressure. Within the
alternative approach adsorption occurs under ambient condition, while for the regeneration step a vacuum
pump reduces the vessel pressure. This process is the called Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption (VPSA).

An important role when designing the product is the choice of the adsorbent. For almost all current
applications of PSA alumosilicates or zeolithes have been designed, tailored to the specific separation
task. Their main advantages include a high selectivity towards a specic gas to be adsorbed as well as a
very homogenous distribution of diameters in the molecular sieve.

\section{Gas permeation}

The separation of mixed gases by membrane process is called gas permeation. Its main strength
in comparison with alternative processes are the low energy consumption and the possibility to
produce flexible mobile units. As mentioned before it is not however capable of producing high
quantity highly pure product streams. As \reffig{fig:tech_compar} illustrates the main application
for the gas permeation process are small to moderate product streams at intermediate purities.

\reffig{fig:gas_permeation} shows the schematic for a single stage membrane unit. Within the feed stream
the gaseous mixture is fed into the unit, which can quickly be implemented. Within the unit one or more
species migrate favorably through the membrane. In this case mostly dense polymer membranes are
employed used. There have been some impressive results with metallic membranes, but due to
the very high material costs they have not been adapted by the industry. Furthermore, since gaseous
phases often have rather small molecular species, porous membranes cannot achieve desired separation.
The driving force the separation process is a difference in partial pressure or species activity across the
membrane. According to the molecular structure of each species, the structure of the separating membrane
as well as the process parameters pressure and temperature, they permeate through the membrane in
different quantities.

The process of permeation can be subdivided into three separate steps. Sorption at the membrane /
feed interface, diffusion through the mostly dense polymer membrane and finally desorption at the
permeate side of the membrane.
