The separation of air finds many application in the modern industry. Pure oxygen and nitrogen are
are essential for many processes. Among the most prominent examples is the production of synthesis gas,
which forms the basis for a multitude of very large scale process operations. In addition the
air separation processes find application as a utility provider rather than producer of raw material
for example in highly efficient integrated combustion cycles \cite{Mahapatra.2010}. Due to the
many different applications, pure nitrogen or oxygen is needed with various demands on
purity, flow rate or phase composition. Therefore different technologies are suitable to specific tasks.

In general three main principles of air separation can be identified; adsorption,
cryogenic distillation and transport through membranes.\Figref{fig:tech_compar} illustrates the most
economically viable processes depending on product purity and product stream volume.
In the remainder of this chapter an overview of the available air separation technologies
will be given. Here the main focus lies on introducing several alternative technologies
and estimating their applicability to different product demands.

    \section{Cryogenic processes}
    \label{sec:cryo_air_sep}
    \begin{figure}

        \label{fig:ASU}

    Cryogenic Air Separation finds applications over a great variety of industries among others refining,
    petrochemicals, medical, food \& beverages and environmental \cite{Sirdeshpande.2005}. \Figref{fig:ASU}
    shows the major unit operations associated with process. Initially the air is compressed and later re-expanded
    to reach the low temperatures required for liquefaction. In an intermediate pre-treatment step most unwanted
    contaminants are removed. Is is essential to properly control the amount of carbon dioxide in the
    gas, as it might freeze out at the low temperatures especially within the heat exchanger. This will result in
    much decreased performance of the heat exchange unit.

    The pre-treated air is then cooled against product streams leaving the separation stage of the process. To which extend
    the refrigeration is  recovered is among the most dominant factors for economic operations. The requirements
    towards the product streams determine how much can be recovered. Most process produce gaseous streams at
    approximately ambient pressure and temperature \cite{Smith.2001} and hence recover the maximum of energy from the
    process. However often a subsequent compression step or even liquefaction step is employed to deliver the
    desired product to the consumer.

    In terms of economically viable operations, the compression denotes a sizable contribution to the capital cost
    and is responsible for the majority of the operating cost. However when recovering liquid product, the
    compression work need to increase to compensate for the loss in recoverable refrigeration. Due to the widespread
    application of the  process and several increasingly complex process configurations are being implemented
    with different strategies, for internal recovery of pressure energy and refrigeration.

    The cryogenic process can most economically simultaneously produce large quantities of highly pure oxygen and nitrogen.
    Furthermore can streams of noble gases, especially argon, be produced. Most alternative technologies will
    produce one single product stream. Additionally can the economy of scale be largely exploited for this
    process, which is why current developments are towards large scale single train that can produce an
    an excess of several thousand tonnes of product stream per day \cite{Castle.2002}.

    \section{Adsorption processes}
    \label{sec:psa}
    Certain materials display a higher affinity to adsorb a specific class of molecules. Nitrogen is
    more easily adsorbed in zeolithes than oxygen. Therefore if air is fed through a
    zeolithe bed, an oxygen rich stream is produced. Since any bed will eventually
    be saturated and its capability for adsorption be exhausted, the process carries a
    inherent discontinuity. However for most processes which yield large product streams
    continuous operations are more cost effective.

    To realize a continuous process multiple adsorption vessels are operated simultaneously.
    Once a bed is saturated, the process is switched to a different vessel and the saturated one
    is regenerated. Regeneration utilizes the change of adsorption capabilities at varying temperature
    or pressure. By increasing temperature or lowering pressure can the bed therefore be regenerated.
    Due to the switching during operations these processes a commonly known as temperature swing adsorption
    (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA). For most industrial applications PSA is preferred due to
    simpler operation and faster cycle times \cite{Smith.2001}.

    Especially the ability to construct very compact units, have led to implementations of PSA processes at 
    very different scales. Briefcase sized units are constructed for treatment of asthma patients or other 
    medical appliances. Larger scale plants have successfully been utilized, for example in the paper industry 
    during the de-lignation of pulp\cite{Nelson.1993}.

    The bed size is the determining factor for equipment cost. Since cycle times are limited by the regeneration
    step, the bed size and therefore the cost increases rapidly with the product flowrate. For very large
    scale operations the cryogenic process is more economically viable. However the process can be operated
    much more flexible due to drastically shorter start-up times than the cryogenic process. Furthermore, no
    by-products can be recovered from the process, without further subsequent separations\cite{Choi.2003}.

    \end{figure}
    
    For continuous operations two separate bed would suffice, however in order to increase cycle times and process 
    throughput as well as exploit possibilities for pressure energy recovery, process configurations with three or more 
    beds are employed. Variations of the process use sub-atmospheric pressures during the regeneration step. Such processes
    are commonly referred to as vacuum swing adsorption (VSA.  

    \section{Membrane processes}
    \label{sec:membrane}
    In case of the membrane process , the type of membrane used leads to very different process characteristics. For the
    production of oxygen either polymeric membranes (PEM) or ion-transport membranes (ITM) are installed.

    	\input{pgfplots/GasPermeation}
	    \caption{Membrane unit for gas permeation.}
    	\label{fig:gas_permeation}
    \end{figure}
    
    Polymeric membranes operate at near ambient conditions. The driving force for separation is the difference 
    diffusion rates through the membrane \cite{Melin.2007}. The product flowrate and selectivity are the 
    determining factors for capital cost. These are mainly dependent on the membrane area. Hence
    the capital cost for the process is expected to rise somewhat linear with the product flowrate.
    The process can economically generate medium process stream ($\approx 20 \; t/d$) at lower purities. 
    The minimal start-up time and operations near ambient conditions make the process ideal for
    applications where oxygen enriched process streams suffice and contaminants such as water or carbon 
    dioxide can be tolerated. Membranes which incorporate active species that facilitate oxygen transport
    trough the membrane bear the potential to greatly improve process performance \cite{Kammermeyer.1976}. 
    In general are the alternative technologies more mature than membrane processes. 
    
    Processes with ion exchange membranes are drastically different from the ones with PEM's. Foremost they
    operate at high temperatures ($\approx 900 K$). At the membrane surface oxygen molecules are ionized 
    and transported through the membrane along an externally applied electric potential. They travel 
    through the membrane at very high flow rates. The process is capable of producing virtually pure 
    oxygen. It is especially suited for integration with power generation processes \cite{Smith.2001}.    
    
    \section{Hybrid processes}
    The three different alternatives presented before constitute the major technologies for separations
    of gases and therefore the production of pure nitrogen and oxygen. All technologies have their specific
    advantages and disadvantages. As the separation of gases remains a major issue when facing upcoming challenges
    for our industries substantial efforts are being made to improve current processes in terms of ecological
    and economic performance. A very promising way to achieve such improvements to combine these technologies
    to form hybrid processes. Membranes offer many favourable characteristics are however rather limited when
    it comes to large flow-rates and high purities. When lower purities are required or the flow-rates are limited
    they offer however an efficient and cost effective way for gas separation. Therefore in the past years several
    alternatives for PSA - membrane \cite{Akinlabi.2007} or membrane-cryogenic distillation processes \cite{Wankat.2011}
    have been studied. The membrane can function within the process either as a pretreatment step, where an product enriched
    stream at medium purities and high flow-rates is produced, or after the main separation, when the main
    byproducts are already removed, as a last stage to reach very high purities.
