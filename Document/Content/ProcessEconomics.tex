\chapter{Process economics}
\label{chp:ProcesEconomics}

Aside from question wether a certain process is capable of producing products according to its 
specifications, it needs to be investigated if it does so in an economically viable manner. The modeling 
of process economics is a powerful tool to estimate project profitability. The evaluation of process 
economics has three major aims in the design phase. 

\regitemize{%
	\item{Compare design options with regard to profitability.}
	\item{Economically optimize a given design.}
	\item{Estimate project profitability}
}%

In any case the total cost of the project as well as the cash flow structure will have to be analyzed to supply 
an accurate estimate of the economic conditions. Furthermore an adequate measure to compare and 
analyze a project in economic terms needs to be employed. 

The following sections will first describe how to estimate the total project cost in different stages of the 
design process. It is evident that, as the more information about a given process becomes available, the 
accuracy of any cost estimate will increase as well. During the design phase of a process roughly three
different stages of cost estimation can be formulated. 
\regitemize{
	\item{An estimate before designing the process yields an order of magnitude estimation 
		for supporting market research efforts. Error $> 30\%$}
	\item{Estimate in the early design phase based on essential process equipment. Error $\pm 30\%$}
	\item{Estimate based on an advanced flowsheet and relevant process parameters. Error $\pm 20\%$}
}
Once detail engineering commences, even more accurate calculations with errors reducing to $\pm 5\%$
can be undertaken\cite{Peters.2003}. At that point a concrete process option will have to be chosen and 
the investment decision will already have to be made. All optimization measures within the scope of this 
thesis will have concluded at that time. 

Within \refsec{sec:ProjectCost} first we will take a look at how the total cost of a chemical process might be 
estimated at different design stages. Subsequently in \refsec{sec:InvestmentCriteria} the different ways
of evaluating a certain investment options and estimating a projects profitability will be discussed. 

\section{Project cost}
\label{sec:ProjectCost}

An important factor in every given project is the total cost. During the design of a chemical process many 
important aspects of the future cost structure are unknown, as the final design is in development. 
In general the total cost of implementing and operating a production site can be broken down into 
several subcategories. 

\regitemize{%
	\item{Battery limit investment}
	\item{Utility investment}
	\item{Off-Site investment}
	\item{Engineering fees}
	\item{Working capital}
}%

\subsection{Before process design}
\label{sec:before}
Before any details about the process to be implemented are known, an estimate can only give an 
order of magnitude towards cost to be expected. The cost of the new process $C_P$ can be 
related to the cost of a reference process $C_{P}^0$ by 
\eq{
	C_P = C_P^0 \cdot \left( \frac{Q_P}{Q_P^0} \right)^x. 
	\label{eq:cost}
	\nomenclature{$C_P$}{Total process cost \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$C_P^0$}{Reference process cost \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$Q_P$}{Process capacity \nomunit{\frac{kg}{h}}}
	\nomenclature{$Q_P^0$}{Reference process capacity \nomunit{\frac{kg}{h}}}
	\nomenclature{$x$}{Degression coefficient \nomunit{-}}
}%
The degression coefficient $x$ needs to be correlated from historical data. 

As the overall price structure will change over time, the reference price will not reflect the current 
market situation. In order to adjust for that shortcoming several price indices are published 
all over the word. Some of those tailor to special branches of the industry, others give a picture
of the price-development in a economy as a whole. The price ration of the prices at different times
will then be equal to the ration of the price indices at the respective times
\eq{
	\frac{C_1}{C_2} = \frac{I_1}{I_2}. 
	\label{eq:index_ratio}
	\nomenclature{$C_1$}{Reference equipment cost at time $1$ \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$C_2$}{Reference equipment cost at time $2$ \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$I_1$}{Cost index at time $1$ \nomunit{-}}
	\nomenclature{$I_2$}{Cost index at time $2$ \nomunit{-}}
}%
For each index an somewhat arbitrary reference year is chosen. Among the most common indices are the 
Marshall \& Swift index, the Nellson-Farrar-Index or the Chemical Engineering index. Some exemplary 
values for these indices are given in \reftab{tab:PriceIndices}. As one can see the development within the 
process industry very well matches the development in the economy as a whole, which is why for this rough
estimate general indices should suffice.

\subsection{During process design}
Once the future design has been has been broken down to fewer potential options and first process 
flowsheets are available a more elaborate approach becomes possible. 

\subsubsection{Battery limit investment} 
The battery limit investment denotes all investments necessary to have all required equipment 
for process operations installed on-site. This includes structures necessary to house the process as well as
delivery and installation of all individual assets.  One major part of these cost will the the process 
equipment. As the exact manufacturers and models of the equipment will not be known in early design 
stages, an approach similar to the one in \refsec{sec:before} still needs to be employed. In contrast to 
before now the cost for individual pieces of process equipment will be considered separately.  
Each piece of equipment will have an specific feature that most influences its cost. For vessels and 
reactors this might be volume, while for heat exchangers the required heat exchange area is essential. 
The price for an piece of equipment  $i$ $C^{i}_E$ can again be approximated by a simple power law
\eq{
	C^{i}_E = C^{i}_B \left( \frac{Q^{i}_E}{Q^{i}_B} \right)^{M^{i}}. 
	\label{eq:equip_cost}
	\nomenclature{$C^{i}_E$}{Cost of equipment $i$ \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$C^{i}_B$}{Reference cost of equipment $i$ \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$Q^{i}$}{Specific quantity for equipment $i$ \nomunit{variable}}
	\nomenclature{$Q^{i}_B$}{Equipment specific reference quantity \nomunit{variable}}
	\nomenclature{$M^{i}$}{Equipment specific factor \nomunit{-}}
}%
A reference price $C^{i}_B$ is multiplied by the determining quantity $Q^{i}$ normalized to a reference state 
$Q^{i}_B$ and raised to the power $M^{i}$ specific to each piece of equipment. Reference prices and 
quantities for various installations can be obtained from literature. 
\todo[inline]{add reference}

If information on the process conditions are available, they also can be considered in price calculations.  
Aside from the mere size of the equipment the process conditions will also have an affect on the expected 
cost. The predominant factors to that respect are pressure, temperature and the question wether corrosive 
or reactive media, which will require more resistant materials, will be present. Furthermore if a more
detailed choice of process equipment is known this is considered as well. For example an plate-fin heat 
exchanger might be more expensive than a tubular model with the same heat-exchange area. 
In order to account for all those effect a form factor $f_F$ is applied to the equipment cost 
\eq{
	C^{i}_E = C^{i}_B \left( \frac{Q^{i}_E}{Q^{i}_B} \right)^{M^{i}} f_F^{i}
		=   C^{i}_B \left( \frac{Q^{i}_E}{Q^{i}_B} \right)^{M^{i}} \underbrace{\left(1 + f^{i}_C + f^{i}_M + f^{i}_P + f^{i}_T\right)}_{= f_F^{i}}. 
	\label{eq:equip_cost_mpt}
	\nomenclature{$f^{i}_C$}{Design complexity correction to equipment cost \nomunit{-}}
	\nomenclature{$f^{i}_M$}{Material selection correction to equipment cost \nomunit{-}}
	\nomenclature{$f^{i}_P$}{Pressure correction to equipment cost \nomunit{-}}
	\nomenclature{$f^{i}_T$}{Temperature correction to equipment cost \nomunit{-}}
}%
Where $f_F$ denotes the form factor, $f_C$ corrects for design complexity, $f_M$ for material selection, 
$f_P$ adjusts for extreme pressures and $f_T$ for temperature. 

As in the previous section all reference prices need to be corrected to compensate for the temporal price
development, Here again the already discussed indices are used. Furthermore can regional changes 
in price structures be considered. Here again have correction factors to prices in an reference region in 
the world (e.g. USA) been published.
\todo[inline]{add ref.}

In addition to the purchased cost, the costs for installing the process equipment have an significant effect 
on the total needed investment of the process. These installation costs include:
\regitemize{%
	\item Installations costs
	\item{Piping ,valves and electrical wiring}
	\item{Control system}
	\item{Structures and foundations}
	\item{Insulation and fire proofing}
	\item{Labour fees}
}%
Those again can be expressed as correction factors to the equipment price. Depending on the status 
of the information available they can be expressed as one unified factor or broken down to each specific 
category. One however needs to bare in mind, that costs for piping and valves -- pieces of equipment
in direct contact with process media -- will be affected by the process conditions in a similar  
way as the actual equipment, whereas the other categories are more likely to remain unchanged. Thus
attention needs to be paid, in with fashion the factors will be applied. 

A word should be said to the cost for the control system. Most obtainable data will most likely refer to 
a decentralized control system, as it has been in use for many years. WIth ever more powerful computers 
a centralized approach, namely model predictive control (MPC) is becoming more relevant. As the 
structure for such a control system may vary significantly from the common designs, the cost factors may 
as well. 
 
\subsubsection{Services}
The utility investments and off-site investments are often referred to as services. Therein included are
all measures necessary to supply the process with the media required for operations. This includes but is
not limited to generation and distribution of energy, steam, process gases. The utility investments  
in this context refer to all investments within the greater production site but out of the battery limits of the 
process. Off-site investments contain everything not contained in the site such as roads, power cables,
communication systems or waste disposal. All these costs are expressed as fractions of the equipment 
cost at moderate temperature and pressure. This means, when applying these fractions, the factors $f_M$, 
$f_P$ and $f_T$ should not be considered at this point. 

Once again in early design stages one has to resort to factors derived for statistical data, to calculate 
the cost of raw materials, energy and support media such as lubricants, heat or catalysts. If more
detailed information on process streams is available the approach should be refined. 

The cost of raw materials $C_{RM}$ can then be calculated if the streams of individual raw materials 
$m_i$ as well as their specific cost are known.  
\eq{
	C_{RM} = \left( \sum_i^{N_{RM}} \dot{m}_i \cdot C_{RM}^{i} \right) \cdot t_{op}. 
	\nomenclature{$N_{RM}$}{Number of raw materials \nomunit{-}}
	\nomenclature{$C_{RM}$}{Total cost of raw materials \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$C^{i}_{RM}$}{Mass specific cost of raw material $i$ \nomunit{\frac{\$}{kg}}}
	\nomenclature{$\dot{m}_i$}{Mass flow of component $i$ \nomunit{\frac{kg}{s}}}
	\nomenclature{$t_{op}$}{Time of process operations \nomunit{s}}
}%

Much in the same way the cost for energy can be calculated. This is once more done for each individual 
pice of equipment, rather then for the whole process as it has been done for the raw materials. Hence
with the needed energy for equipment $i$ with respect to energy carrier $j$ $e_{ij}$ along with 
the price for energy carrier $j$ $C_{EC}^j$ the total energy cost $C_{EC}$ can be assessed. 
\eq{
	C_{EC} = \left( \sum_i^{N_{E}} \sum_j^{N_{EC}} \dot{e}_{ij} \cdot C_{EC}^{i} \right) \cdot t_{op}. 
	\nomenclature{$N_{E}$}{Number of equipment pieces in the process \nomunit{-}}
	\nomenclature{$C_{EC}$}{Total cost of energy \nomunit{\$}}
	\nomenclature{$C^{i}_{EC}$}{Mass specific cost of energy carrier $i$ \nomunit{\frac{\$}{kW}}}
	\nomenclature{$\dot{e}_{ij}$}{Energy flow of to equipment $i$ from energy carrier $j$ \nomunit{kW}}
}%

\subsubsection{Working capital}
The working capital includes all investments necessary for process operations. This means raw
materials, payroll, extended credit to customers and so on. In contrast to all other costs the 
working capital can partially be retrieved when the process stops operations. How different 
types of cash flows, extended or owed credit should be handled will be disused in 
\refsec{sec:InvestmentCriteria}. This section will focus on how raw materials and process media 
contribute to the total process cost. 

\subsubsection{Total investment}
When all contributions to the total investment are considered an estimate for the total price of the 
process can be calculated
\eq{
	C_P = \sum_i^{N_E} \left[ C_{B}^{i} \left( \frac{Q^{i}}{Q^{i}_{B}} \right)^{M^{i}} 
		\left(f_F \cdot f_{PIPE} + \sum_j f_j \right)\right] + C_{RM} + C_{EC} + C_{FILL}
}%
It should be emphasized that in early design stages these calculations will at best yield an order of
magnitude estimate for the expected cost of implementing a chemical process. Most literature sources 
give an accuracy of $\pm 30 \%$  \cite{Peters.2003}. As the poject progresses more and more information 
becomes available an a more accurate estimate can be prepared. Those often rely on actual proposals
from prospective manufacturers and suppliers. 


\section{Investment criteria}
\label{sec:InvestmentCriteria}
The total cost of a project its a very important measure to decide wether to undergo a certain endeavor. 
However in a complex financial system it cannot be taken as the sole factor to compare investment 
alternatives. Different other indices are used to measure the attractiveness of an investment. One 
main destination can be made between different measurements. This is wether the time value of many
is considered. First two measurements -- payback time and return of investment (ROI) -- not considering time 
value will be discussed. By analyzing time dependent cash flows indices can be derived, that yield a more 
realistic view of the economic situation. Out of those the net present value (NPV) as well as the 
discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFRR) are introduced.

\subsubsection{Specific production cost}

\subsubsection{Payback time}
 Payback time is the time necessary to earn the total investment of the process. It is also often referred to as 
 the break even point. A profitable venture will form that point on begin to make money. A shorter 
 payback time is a measure for an more attractive investment. 
\eq{
	POT = \frac{\textnormal{capital expenditure}}{\textnormal{incoming cash flow / period}}
}
\subsubsection{Return of investment}
The return of investment is defined as 
\eq{
	ROI = \frac{\textnormal{average return / period}}{\textnormal{capital expenditure}} \cdot 100 \%.
	\label{eq:roi}
}%
In terms of capital expenditure (CAPEX) a congruent measure for all compared options needs to be chosen.
