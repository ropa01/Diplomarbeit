\chapter{Process optimization}
\label{chp:optimization}
In this chapter first some theoretical aspects are discussed. Namely in the first section some theoretical aspects of 
convex optimization followed by an overview of current solution techniques for discrete-continuous or mixed-integer
nonlinear programs (MINLP). In the last section of this chapter some applications of optimization with the cryogenic 
air separation process are presented.
