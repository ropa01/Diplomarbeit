        The developed models were combined to a process flowsheet for the cryogenic air separation process.
        As no specific process was being evaluated, the process configuration was modeled after an
        published example process flowsheet \cite{Kooijman.}. \Figref{fig:opt:exppro}
        shows the flowsheet considered henceforth. Air is drawn from the surrounding at ambient conditions
        and compressed with inter-cooling stages. Afterwards the entering process stream exchange heat
        with the product streams.

        The stream is then divided into two separate streams. One part is expanded in a turbine, and fed to
        the low pressure column (LPC) while the majority is fed to the high pressure column (HPC).
        Condenser and reboiler are combined in a single unit. A side column to the LPC generates pure
        argon. The condensate form the HPC is partially fed into the LPC. The oxygen rich sump product form the HPC
        is used to condensate the CAC top product, and afterwards fed into the LPC. From the reboiler side liquid oxygen
        is recovered from the process. From the top of LPC and HPC gaseous nitrogen is drawn. Liquid Argon is drawn from
        the CAC condenser.

        AS can be seen, this process is highly integrated with respect to energy and material streams. For both the
        steady-state and dynamic process model, the same separation sequence is considered. Compression and heat-exchange
        are only explicitly modeled in the steady-state process. While the steady-state models do provide the possibility
        to calculate pressure drops by means of an hydraulic model, they were assumed constant in all steady-state applications.
        When using the dynamic models, hydraulic equations have to be considered. For the case of the ASU process different column
        internals are often installed. The HPC as the smallest column can be economically operated as a trayed column, hence the
        respective hydraulic and cost models were employed there. The LPC and CAC are mostly equipped with structured
        packings.

        Another difference in the steady-state and dynamic models was the considered superstructure. For optimizing the number
        of separation stages, a maximum value needs to be guessed. In the steady-state case those were set to 40 for the HPC
        and 60 for the LPC and CAC respectively. With the steady-state results in mind, these were reduced to 25 for the HPC
        and 45 for LPC and CAC when constructing the dynamic process.
