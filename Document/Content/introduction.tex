Air separation technology, or -- more generally speaking -- gas separation technology, lies at the heart of the modern 
process industry. Highly pure oxygen and nitrogen ore uses in many industrial applications. Modern power generation
processes, such as the currently developed OXICOAL process, rely on incineration with pure oxygen to produce
flue gases with very high carbon dioxide content for further storage. Nitrogen is essential to many widely used 
processes such as the production of ammonia in the Haber-Bosch synthesis, as  fertilizer or in many organic reactions.
