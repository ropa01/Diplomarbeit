    Distillation columns are among the most widely studied pieces of process equipment. While much has been
    accomplished, the robust simulation poses great challenges to this day. In the context of cryogenic
    air separation the associated mixture displays only moderate non-idealities and furthermore is
    a zeotropic one. However further complexity is added due to the strong interdependencies of the different
    columns arising from thermal and material coupling within the process.

    In this section first the mathematical formulation for a general steady-state distillation column model will
    be presented (\secref{sec:mathpro:steady:distmodel}). The

    \subsubsection{Distillation column model}
    \label{sec:mathpro:steady:distmodel}

        In this section the working equations used to model the different distillation columns in the process,
        known as the MESH equations, are given. These equations, although rather plain at first glimpse, form a
        set of highly non-linear, highly coupled equations. The solutions of these equations is not a trivial
        task for current solution algorithms, whose success is highly dependent on the quality of initial guesses
        provided. Therefore a strategy used for the automated generation of such guesses will be described as well.

        The model presented here is not only to be used for the simulation of of a given process, but rather
        for optimization purposes as well. While several of the continuous decision variables associated
        whit process optimization can be optimized from a generic set of equations, others need further consideration.
        The optimization decision which adds the greatest complexity for distillation columns ist the number
        of trays used in a given separation process. This introduces integer decisions into the model and requires
        development of a super structure to be used.

        The starting point for the modeling a distillation column is considering a single separation stage within the
        column with all possible connections. \Figref{fig:col_super} shows the superstructure to be used for the complete
        column, while \figref{fig:col_stage_super} shows a super structure for a singe stage.

        As mentioned before the governing equations for a distillation column a known as MESH equations. The acronym
        MESH stands for material, equilibrium, summation and enthalpy. The corresponding equations are as follows.
        If not stated otherwise, all equations presented in this section are true for all stages. In order
        to improve readability the indices denoting a stage are omitted, if not essential for the meaning of
        a given equation. For all equations the number of stages in the process is denoted by $n_S$, while $n_C$
        stands for the number of components.

        \ncr{z^L_{ij}}{liquid mole fraction of liquid feed to stage $j$}{-}
        \ncr{z^V_{ij}}{vapour mole fraction of vapour feed to stage $j$}{-}

        Here the vapour $F^V_j$ and liquid $F^L_j$ phase of the feed to the stage $j$ are considered separately.
        While this is not strictly necessary is allows for certain freedoms in terms of modelling
        column operations, as sometimes the vapour fraction of a given feed is actually fed into
        the vapour phase of a stage and therefore effectively in the liquid phase of the stage above.

        A certain amount of the liquid or vapour leaving a stage can be withdrawn from the column by means
        of the vapour $S^V_j$ and liquid $S^L_j$ side draw streams. However it is convenient and seemed
        to facilitate convergence to define the side draws in terms of dimensionless fractions by relating them
        to the respective vapour or liquid stream leaving the stage

        \Eq{eq:val:vap:strip}{
            s_j^V = \frac{S_j^V}{V_j}, \eqanns, \\
            s_j^L = \frac{S_j^L}{V_j}, \eqanns.

        \ncr{s^V_j}{dimensionless liquid side-draw from stage $j$}{-}

        By considering these dimensionless the vapour $s_j^V$ and liquid $s_j^L$ side draws the material
        balance can be rewritten as
        \Eqml{eq:col:CompBalance}{
    		0 = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot y_{i,j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)
                \cdot L_j \cdot x_{i,j} - V_{j+1} \cdot y_{i,j+1} - L_{j-1} \cdot x_{i,j-1}
                \\ - F_j^V \cdot z^V_{i,j} - F_j^L \cdot z_{i,j}^L, \eqanncs.
    	}%

        As the model is also to be used for optimization purposes further extensions are necessary.
        The location of individual feeds as well as the number of theoretical or real stages of the
        column is to be optimized. To accommodate that need, new variables are need, namely the feed
        split $\zeta_{ij}^F$ for feed $i$ to stage $j$ as employed by \cite{Dunnebier.1999} are introduced.
        The split variables are integer variables that can take a value of either $0$ or $1$. Additionally it is
        assumed that each feed will only be fed to a single stage thus
        \Eq{eq:col:feedsplit}{
            1 =  \sum_{j=1}^N \zeta_{ij}, \eqannote{i = 1 \dots n_F, \quad j = 1 \dots n_S},
        }%
        \ncr{n_F}{number of feeds}{-}
        where $n_F$ denotes the number of feeds, comprised of vapour ($F^V$) and liquid $F^L$ feeds.

        In order to optimize the number of stages several superstructures are possible. One can
        optimize the reboiler reflux location and condenser reflux location or each single one
        along with the feed and side draw locations. The stage number is then changed as all stages
        between condenser or reboiler reflux are effectively rendered inactive. The solution of
        the mass and energy balances for each respective stages becomes trivial as only one single
        vapour or liquid stream enters and exits the stage. While the choice if condenser and or reboiler
        reflux is optimized is somewhat arbitrary some studies have shown \cite{Grossmann.2005} that
        the strategy of optimizing only feed location and reboiler reflux location possesses some
        numerical advantages in terms of performance of the solution algorithm.

        With the newly introduced split variables for liquid $\zeta^L_{ij}$ and vapour $\zeta^V_{ij}$
        as well as the reboiler reflux $\zeta^R_j$ and the liquid $\zeta^{SL}_{ij}$ and vapour $\zeta^{SV}_{ij}$
        side draws, the material balances can be written as
        \Eqml{eq:col:CompBalance_opt}{
    		0 = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot y_{i,j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)
                \cdot L_j \cdot x_{i,j} - V_{j+1} \cdot y_{i,j+1} \\ \hfill - L_{j-1} \cdot x_{i,j-1}
                - \sum_{k=1}^{n_F} \zeta_{kj} \cdot F_j^V \cdot z^V_{i,j} - \sum_{l=1}^{n_F}%
                \zeta_{lj} \cdot F_j^L \cdot z_{i,j}^L - \zeta^R_j \cdot V_{n_S} \cdot y_{in_S}, \hfill%
                \\ \eqannote{i = 1 \dots C, \quad j = 1 \dots n_S, \quad k = 1 \dots n_F, \quad l = 1 \dots n_F}.
    	}%
        \ncg{\zeta^{L}_{ij}}{splitting variable for liquid feed $i$ on stage $j$}{-}
        \ncg{\zeta^{V}_{ij}}{splitting variable for vapour feed $i$ on stage $j$}{-}

        \ncg{\zeta^{R}_{j}}{splitting variable for reboiler reflux on stage $j$}{-}

        Furthermore to be able to optimize side draws, the stripping factors have to be reformulated
        accordingly
        \Eq{eq:val:vap:strip_opt}{
            s_j^V = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{S^V} \zeta^{SV}_{ij} S_j^V}{V_j}, \eqannote{j = 1 \dots N, \quad i = 1 \dots S^V},
        }%
        \Eq{eq:val:liq:strip_opt}{
            s_j^V = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{S^L} \zeta^{SL}_{ij} S_j^L}{L_j}, \eqannote{j = 1 \dots N, \quad i = 1 \dots S^L}.
        }%


        \paragraph{Equilibrium} between a vapour and liquid pase ia achieved when the chemical potentials for each
        component in the pases are equal. This is commonly expressed by a equilibrium $K_i$ constant. With
        that the equilibrium equation can be written as
        \Eq{eq:col:Kxy}{
            y_{i}^{eq} = K_{i} \cdot x_{i}, \eqannc.
    	}%
        \ncr{K_{ij}}{equilibrium constant of component $i$ on stage $j$}{-}
        \ncr{y_{i}^{eq}}{equilibrium vapour concentration of component $i$ on stage $j$}{\frac{mol}{mol}}

        The requirement for equal chemical potentials can be expressed in terms of the vapour $f_i^V$
        and liquid $f_i^L$ fugacities \cite{AndreasPfennig.2003}.
        \Eq{eq:col:fug}{
            f_i^V = f_i^L, \eqannc.
    	}%
        \ncr{f_i^V}{vapour fugacity}{-}
        \ncr{f_i^L}{liquid fugacity}{-}

        This can also be written in terms of the, liquid activity coefficient $\gamma_i$,
        the pointing factor $F_{Pi}$, the reference vapour fugacity coefficient $\varphi_i$,
        the vapour pressure $p^S_i$ as well as the system pressure $p$ along with the vapour and
        liquid molar fractions
        \Eq{eq:col:fug_ext}{
            \gamma_i \, F_{Pi} \, \varphi^0_i \, p^S_i \, x_i = \varphi_i \, p \, y_i, \eqannc.
    	}%
        \ncg{\gamma_i}{liquid activity coefficient of component $i$}{-}
        \ncg{\varphi^0_i}{reference vapour fugacity coefficient of component $i$}{-}
        \ncg{\varphi_i}{vapour fugacity coefficient of component $i$}{-}
        \ncr{p^S_i}{vapour pressure of component $i$}{Pa}
        \ncr{p}{system pressure}{Pa}
        \ncr{F_{Pi}}{compressibility factor of component $i$}{-}

        By reformulating \eqref{eq:col:fug_ext} an expression for the equilibrium ratios
        can be derived
        \Eq{eq:col:fug_ext}{
            y_i^{eq} = \underbrace{\frac{\gamma_i \, F_{Pi} \, \varphi^0_i \, p^S_i}{\varphi_i \, p}}_{K_i}
                x_i, \eqannc.
    	}%

        The equations to determine the quantities used when computing the equilibrium ratios are by
        themselves functions of temperature, pressure, and vapour as well as liquid molar fractions.
        They are further discussed in \secref{sec:peng-rob}. It therefore becomes evident that the
        equilibrium ratios are a major source  non-linearities in the MESH equations.

        When simulating a distillation process one might consider only equilibrium stages. This however
        will in most cases not reflect the true behaviour of a given stage as the time a vapour and
        liquid phase are in contact might not be sufficient to achieve equilibrium. This can be accounted
        for by introducing the Murphee tray efficiency \cite{Henley.op.2011}
        \Eq{eq:ss:murphee}{
            \eta^{eq}_{ij} = \frac{y_{ij} - y_{ij+1}}{y_{ij}^{eq} - y_{ij+1}} \eqanncs.
        }

        While several models to approximate these efficiencies have been investigated, their predictions are
        most often rather poor \cite{Coulson.1999} and their evaluation rather complex. Furthermore as indicated
        in the formula they might differ for different species involved. For the scope of this model however
        they are not computed separately, but rather supplied and assumes uniform for each stage and component.

        \paragraph{Enthalpy balances} are again written considering the previously defined stripping factors
        and splitting variables
    	\Eqml{eq:col:EnergyBalance}{
    		0 = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot h^V_{j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)

                \\ \eqannote{i = 1 \dots C, \quad j = 1 \dots N, \quad k = 1 \dots n_F, \quad l = 1 \dots n_F}.

        \ncr{h^{FL}_j}{molar liquid feed enthalpy to stage $j$}{\molenth}

        \paragraph{Condenser and reboiler} are modeled more or less as regular column stages. However they possess
        certain specialties that are explicitly considered in the column model. For one it is assumed
        that no feeds enter the reboiler and condenser stage. Furthermore no vapour side stream is
        drawn from the condenser stage and no liquid side stream from the reboiler stage.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

            \end{subfigure}
        \end{figure}

        Additionally the condenser stage needs to examined a little further. In terms of operations
        several assumptions can be made for the condenser. In general one can distinguish a total,
        partial vapour and partial vapour liquid condenser. For the total condenser all vapour that
        enters the respective stage is condensed and only liquid product is drawn . The partial vapour
        condenser condenses only the vapour the is fed back into
        the column and all product that is drawn is gaseous. The partial vapour liquid condenser
        denotes the most general case, where part of the incoming vapour is condensed and product
        is drawn from the vapour and liquid phase. The most important thing to consider in these different cases,
        is that while in both partial condensers a vapour liquid equilibrium takes place, due to the
        absence of vapour the same does not hold for the total condenser. To accommodate that fact
        the MESH equations have to be adjusted \cite{Naphtali.1971}. While the material and energy
        balances remain unchanged the equilibrium equations have to be altered. First the vapour and
        liquid compositions are set equal for all but one component
        \Eq{eq:col:total}{
            x_{i1} = y_{i1} \eqannote{i = 1 \dots C-1},
        }%
        and the condenser temperature is determined by the bubble point equation
        \Eq{eq:col:bub}{
            1 = \sum_i K_{i1}(T_1, p_1,x_1,y_1) \cdot x_{i1} \eqannc.
        }%

        When implementing the model in a process simulator it is sensible to consider, that due to
        the limited accuracy of computers the omitted component in \eqref{eq:col:total} needs to
        a non-trace component in the condenser stage. The implemented model therefore as to specify
        such a component when a total condenser is chosen to avoid numerical difficulties.

        In practice it is highly unlikely, that the exact amount of energy required to condensate all
        liquid will be drawn from the condenser. More likely, if all vapour is condensed, a little more
        energy will be withdrawn and slightly sub-cooled liquid will leave the condenser. Therefore
        the model includes the possibility to specify a degree of sub-cooling $T^{sub}$ which will be
        considered when calculating bubble point temperature

        \Eq{eq:col:bub}{
            1 = \sum_i K_{i1}(T_1 + T^{sub}, p_1,x_1,y_1) \cdot x_{i1} \eqannc.
        }%
        \ncr{T^{sub}}{sub-cooling temperature}{K}

        \paragraph{Pressure} along the entire column is often specified in the steady-state case
        However as it is inconvenient and unpractical to specify a pressure for each stage one might either specify
        a pressure at the top and bottom stage and assume a uniform pressure profile along the column, or
        specify either top $p_1$ or bottom pressure $p_N$ along with a total pressure drop $\Delta p$,
        or a stage-wise one $\Delta p_{stage}$. However the issue is further complicated if one considers the
        case of optimization for number of trays. In that case several trays will become inactive. For those
        trays the mass and energy balances become trivial, as only liquid enters and exits these trays.
        (For the case employed here, where the reboiler reflux is being optimized). This also means,
        that from the last active tray down to the reboiler -- if present -- there should be a uniform
        profile. however, if a uniform pressure profile from that stage down is not enforced, the solver
        will have to compensate for slight changes in the equilibrium due to pressure variations with minimal
        vapour flow-rates. This is very undesirable, as it might to lead to severe problems in the solver,
        or the calculation of other properties, dependent on these values. To account for this issue, the reboiler
        reflux split can once more be employed
        \Eq{}{
            p_i = p_{j-1} + \left(1 - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \zeta^R_k \right) \cdot \Delta p_{j-1} \eqanns.
        }
        \ncr{\Delta p}{pressure drop over entire column}{Pa}
        \ncr{\Delta p_{stage}}{stage-wise pressure drop}{Pa}

        As an alternative to specifying the pressure, one might consider calculating the pressure drop
        form (semi)-empirical models. There a numerous correlations for different types of column internals.
        These correlations become particularly important id column dynamics are to be considered, as they
        make a connection between holdups and flow-rates within the column. Two different pressure drop models
        have been implemented, one for trayed columns and another one for structured packings. As they are closely
        tied to dynamics, they will be discussed in closed detail in \secref{chp:dynamics}.

    \subsubsection{Specifications \& initialization}
    \label{sec:mathpro:steady:specinit}

        The equation systems presented above is comprised of $NC$ component balances, $NC$ equilibrium
        equations, $2N$ summation equations and $N$ energy balances. This gives a total of $N (2C + 3)$
        equations. On the other hand there are $N$ temperatures and pressures, $2N$ molar flow rates,
        $N$ energy streams, and $NC$ vapour as well as and liquid concentrations. Additionally the feed flow rates
        compositions and temperatures and the side draw split fractions or flow rates appear as variables. The
        feeds and side draws would usually be specified, which leaves a total of $N (2C + 5)$ variables.

        The pressure profile of a distillation column is usually specified. Either by explicitly
        assigning a given pressure to each stage, or more conveniently by defining a pressure
        either the top or bottom pressure as well as the pressure drop per stage
        \Eq{eq:col_pprofile}{
            \Delta p_{stage} = p_i - p_{i-1}, \eqannote{i = 2 \dots N}.
        }
        In terms of unit operations this pressure drop is of high significance,
        as many columns can only be feasibly operated, if the pressure drop does not exceed certain
        limits. In case of the ASU the production of Argon only became feasible as structured
        packings, which display a very low pressure drop, became available. This is due to the large
        number of theoretical stages required to attain the desired Argon purities.

        The energies $Q_i$ denote addition heaters or cooler on the respective stages. For all
        intermediate stages these values would be specified as well. If all energies would be
        specified, that would -- along with the pressure profile -- sum up to $2N$ specifications,
        which leaves $N (2C + 3)$ unknowns. As the number of equations and unknowns are the equal,
        this system can then be solved.

        In practice it is often challenging to correctly guess the condenser and reboiler heat loads in
        advance. This is especially true since they have a tremendous impact on the overall performance
        of the column. Hence it is often desirable to supply other specifications than the respective
        heat loads. To allow for such specification so called discrepancy functions can be introduced
        \cite{Henley.op.2011}, which replace the energy balance for the condenser and / or reboiler stage.

        One common specification is the so called reflux ratio $\nu^D = \frac{L_1}{V_1 + S_1^L}$ for
        the condenser, or the boilup ratio $\nu^R = \frac{L_N}{V_N}$ for the reboiler.
        They are defined as the ratio of the molar flowrate sent back into the column over the
        product flowrate which leaves the column. For the reboiler this denotes a liquid stream,
        while for the condenser the product can be gaseous and liquid. Specifying this leads to
        \Eq{eq:reflux}{
            0 & = L_1 - \nu^D \cdot (V_1 + S_1^L), \\
            0 & = V_N - \nu^R \cdot L_N,
        }
        \ncg{\nu^R}{boliup ratio}{-}
        \ncg{\nu^D}{reflux ratio}{-}
        as discrepancy functions. I addition to that further specifications are conceivable. Most
        commonly distillate ($D$) or bottoms ($B$) flow rates, or purities, component flow rates ($d_i, b_i$)
        or temperatures. The corresponding discrepancy functions are summarized in \tabref{tab:discrepancy}.

        \begin{table}
            \centering
            \footnotesize
            \input{Tables/Discrepancy}
            \caption{discrepancy functions for different column specifications.}
            \label{tab:discrepancy}
        \end{table}

        The specifications for the reboiler stage are quite straightforward, in contrast to that,
        different cases for the condenser have to be considered. In the most general case the
        top product can be drawn as vapour and liquid. This case is here called a partial vapour
        liquid condenser. The other cases are a total condenser, where all the vapour entering the
        condenser stage is condensed, and all product is drawn as a liquid stream, as well as
        a partial vapour condenser, where only the reflux is condensed and all product is drawn
        as vapour. As discussed earlier no VLE takes place in the condenser stage, if a total
        condenser is specified, which needs to be accounted for. Both the total and partial
        vapour condensed implicitly include an extra specification since in former case
        the top vapour product flow rate becomes zero and in the latter the top liquid product
        flowrate. Furthermore a specification of the condenser energy is infeasible as well as implicitly
        given for the total condenser. In case of the partial vapour liquid condenser no implicit
        specification is given, which requires an additional specification. In general two
        top specifications are necessary, whereas only one bottom specification is required.
        These top specification can include the condenser duty, any top flowrate, the reflux ratio
        as well as a newly introduced quantity, the top vapour fraction defined as
        \Eq{}{
            \nu^{vap} = \frac{V_1}{V_1 + S_1^L}.
        }
        \ncg{\nu^{vap}}{condenser vapour fraction}{-}

        As mentioned before the solution of the MESH equations can pose a considerable problem
        to numerical solvers. It is therefore necessary to supply the solver with feasible
        estimates for the involved variables that can be used as an initial guess for
        convergence of the process model. A lot of effort has been spend to formulate robust strategies
        to initialize distillation column models. One of the most prominent is the so called
        Inside-Out algorithm first introduced by Boston and Sullivan \cite{Boston.1974}. Within this
        algorithm an inner and outer iterative loop are employed. Within the outer loop approximate
        parameters for simplified models of phase equilibrium and enthalpy are computed by rigorous
        thermodynamic models and guesses for stage temperatures and concentrations. Within the
        inner loop new stage temperatures and concentrations are attained by solving the MESH equations
        using the simplified thermodynamic models. Once the inner loop converges the simplified
        model parameters are updated within the outer loop by means of the newly calculated
        temperatures and concentrations. This algorithm converges in many cases even for very poor initial
        guesses and has been extended to handle complex columns with side-draws and even reactive
        distillation \cite{Boston.}. It is still in use in the process simulator \aspen.
        However as it is used within an modular algorithmic environment it is not applicable
        to equation based simulators such as \gproms.

        More recently other approaches have been published to attain improved initial guesses.
        Fletcher and Morton \cite{Fletcher.2000} proposed the solution of a column model at
        infinite reflux and zero feed flow rate. This leads to a much simplified model which can
        be solved more easily. The computed purities and stage numbers can give valuable insight
        into the process model. As this approach relies on the solution of a simplified model
        and has no algorithmic elements, it can be implemented in equation based process simulators.

        Another strategy that has been successfully applied to zeotropic and azeotropic mixtures
        relies on solving the column model for the limiting case of the adiabatic column \cite{Barttfeld.2002}.
        The adiabatic column in this case is the column with the minimal entropy production in a real column.
        To avoid entropy production all streams that come in contact must be in equilibrium. To achieve this
        the column would have to employ an infinite number of stages and have an infinite number of
        heat exchangers along its length. The adiabatic column then uses only two heat exchanger in the
        condenser and reboiler stage and assumes a pinch point at the feed stage. \todo{elaborate on adiabatic column}

        Furthermore a much simpler approach has proven adequate for many applications \cite{Henley.op.2011}
        which is also employed as a starting point in this work.
        Therein feed properties are used as initial guesses. First a linear temperature profile form the boiling
        temperature to dew temperature of the combined feed mixture is used to initialize temperatures, whereas a simple flash
        at average column pressure and feed temperature yields a vapour and liquid concentration which is
        used as uniform profile for every column stage. However as the feed might be sub-cooled liquid or
        super-heated vapour, the TP-Flash is replaced by a specified vapour fraction. As vapour fraction
        for the flash initial estimates of the vapour and liquid flow rates at the top and bottom of the
        column are used. The stage-wise molar flow-rates are computed from the constant molal overflow
        assumption, which postulates a constant heat of vaporization and yields therefore uniform
        liquid and vapour flow-rates within a column section. A section in this case is denoted by any
        feed location where the flow-rates change due to the added feed. In the feed stages a super heated
        or sub-cooled feed is also considered by means of an extended vapour fraction
        \Eq{}{
            q^F = \frac{h^F - h^L}{h^V - h^L}.
        }

        While this approach leads to model convergence in many cases, it is not entirely robust.
        While the system considered in this case displays only moderate non-idealities it is highly cupeled.
        Especially the low pressure column (LPC) has multiple feeds and side draws, which leads to non-convergence
        if the aforementioned initialization strategy is employed. However the fact that the system is
        not highly non-ideal can be exploited. Whenever the K-values are not too much dependent on mixture
        composition an intermediate step can be used to refine concentration guesses. The constant molal
        overflow assumption is retained and the equilibrium ratios are computed based on the initial guesses
        from the first stage. The component balance is then reformulated only in terms of liquid component
        flow-rates $l_{ij}$

        \Eqml{eq:init:compbalance}{
            0 = \left((1+s_j^V) \cdot K_{ij} \cdot \frac{V_j}{L_j} + (1+s_j^L) \right) \cdot l_{ij}
                - \frac{V_{j+1}}{L_{j+1}} \cdot K_{ij+1} \cdot l_{ij+1} - l_{ij-1}
                \\ - F_j^V \cdot z^V_{i,j} - F_j^L \cdot z_{i,j}^L, \eqanncs.
        }%
        \ncr{l_{ij}}{liquid molar flowrate of component $i$ from stage $j$}{\mols}
        \ncr{v_{ij}}{vapour molar flowrate of component $i$ from stage $j$}{\mols}

        \eqref{eq:init:compbalance} is linear in the liquid component flow rates. Furthermore vapour component
        flow rates are substituted in the linear component balance and can be computed by

        \Eq{eq:init:vapflow}{
            v_{ij} =  K_{ij} \cdot \frac{V_j}{L_j} \cdot l_{ij} \eqanncs.
        }%

        On of the reasons \eqref{eq:init:compbalance} is formulated in terms of component flow rates rather
        than molar fractions, is that the molar fraction computed in that manner would not be normalized. If
        the mole fractions are computed from the component flow rates normalization is implicitly given

        \Eq{eq:init:liqmolefrac}{
            x_{ij} = \frac{l_{ij}}{\sum_k^C l_{kj}} \eqanncs,
        }%
        \Eq{eq:init:vapmolefrac}{
            y_{ij} = \frac{v_{ij}}{\sum_k^C v_{kj}} \eqanncs.
        }%

        The total molar flow rates used in \eqref{eq:init:compbalance} are computed by solving
        stage-wise total mass balances under the constant molal overflow assumption. This assumption
        postulates that the heat of vaporization is independent of system composition.
        Therefore always the same amount of liquid enters and leaves a given stage
    	\Eq{eq:col:cmo}{
    		0 = L_j + S_j^L - L_{j-1} - (1 + q_F^L) \cdot F_j^L - q_F^V \cdot F_j^V
                \eqannote{j = 1 \dots N}.
    	}%
        \ncr{F_j^V}{Vapour feed to tray $j$}{\frac{mol}{s}}
    	\ncr{F_j^L}{Liquid feed to tray $j$}{\frac{mol}{s}}
    	\ncr{S_j^V}{Vapour side flow from tray $j$}{\frac{mol}{s}}
    	\ncr{S_j^L}{Liquid side flow from tray $j$}{\frac{mol}{s}}
    	\ncr{V_j}{Vapour flow from tray $j$}{\frac{mol}{s}}
    	\ncr{L_j}{Liquid flow from tray $j$}{\frac{mol}{s}}

        Only at feed and side draw stages the total flow rates change. To introduce some more accuracy
        to the model, the available information about the feed is considered. When a feed enters as
        super-heated vapour or sub-cooled liquid, it has the capability to evaporate some liquid or
        liquefy some vapour. To account for that fact the feed energy parameters $q_F^L$ and $q_F^V$
        are introduced
        \Eq{eq:feed_en_param}{
            q_i^{FV} & = \frac{H_i^{FV} - H^V_i}{H^V_i - H^L_i}, \eqannote{i = 1 \dots F^V}, \\
            q_i^{FL} & = \frac{H_i^{FL} - H^L_i}{H^V_i - H^L_i}, \eqannote{i = 1 \dots F^L}.
        }

        The vapour total flow rates are then computed from the total mass balances
        \Eq{eq:col:MassBalance}{
    		0 = L_j + S_j^L + V_j + S_j^V - L_{j-1} - V_{j+1} - F_j^L -  F_j^V,
                \eqannote{j = 1 \dots N}.
    	}%

        As no energy balances are included at this stage, the condenser and reboiler stage
        are characterized by the reflux ($\nu^c = \frac{V_1}{L_1}$) or boilup ratio
        ($\nu^r = \frac{V_N}{L_N}$) respectively. This leads to
        \Eq{eq:boilup}{
            0 = V_1 - \nu^c \cdot L_1, \\
            0 = L_N - \nu^r \cdot V_N.
        }

        To close the equation system the global mass balance is included
        \Eq{eq:globalmassbalance}{
            0 = V_1 + L_N + \sum_{j=1}^{N} ( S_j^V + S_j^L - F_j^V - F_j^L ),
                \eqannote{j = 1 \dots N}.
        }

        For more complex systems more elaborate strategies have been developed, which essentially try
        to incorporate some of the principals from the inside out algorithm into an equation based
        environment. The process simulator \gproms allows for definition of standardized initialization
        procedures as well as different model variants that can be solved consecutively. With that strategies
        were developed that proved successful for more complex mixtures and even three phase systems. As
        these strategies are closely linked to the implementation in \gproms and the programm
        capabilities, they will be discussed in \secref{sec:mathpro:implementation}

        Furthermore ist should be noted, that not all specifications are compatible with the initialization
        strategies described above. While this issue has been addressed, it also will be explained in the
        implementation section.

        \paragraph{Example}

        \begin{figure}
            \begin{minipage}{0.25\textwidth}
                \input{Pictures/LPC_example}

            \end{minipage}
        \end{figure}

        To illustrate how the initialization procedure works an example has been constructed of
        a rather complex column -- or column section -- with multiple feeds and side draws (\figref{fig:lpc_example}).
        It is taken from an example process of cryogenic air separation. The column in question
        is a column section without an condenser stage and displayed the most difficulties in terms
        of convergence when constructing the process flowsheet.

        In addition to the aforemention initialization strategy, columns with side draws present are handled
        in a slightly different manner. Initially the side draws are disregarded. Then the initialization procedure
        is carried out. Once the column without side draws has converged, a homotopy approach
        \Eq{eq:homotopy}{
            f(\vec{x}) = (1-\alpha) \cdot f_0(\vec{x}) + \alpha \cdot f_1(\vec{x})
        }
        is employed, where the parameter $\alpha$ is initially set to zero and then gradually moved to a value
        of one. \todo{mention problems and bounded homotopy?} During the initialization homotopies could
        generally be employed to move from one step to another. While in some cases robustness is improved by
        such a strategy, it is always computationally far more expensive then simply jumping between different
        stages.

        For clarity reasons the different steps of the initializations procedure a repeated in a tabular manner
