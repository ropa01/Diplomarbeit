 \subsection{Integrated condenser \& reboiler}
    \label{sec:mathpro:steady:conreb}
        \begin{figure}
            \center
            \input{Pictures/condenser_reboiler}
            \caption{Integrated condenser \& reboiler unit.}
            \label{fig:mathpro:conreb_ss}
        \end{figure}

        The integrated condenser reboiler unit is a peculiarity of the ASU process. The fact that condenser and 
        reboiler are linked form the close coupling between both sections of the double effect column. 
        This stems from the fact, that each change in the parameters and operation of this unit will reverberate 
        through the entire process, as they will simultaneously affect boil-up ratio and reflux
        ratio of the column, both major operational parameters with great effect. 
        
        Therefore a separate model for this unit was developed, rather that simply establishing a couple between the
        the condenser and the reboiler in the case for two separately modeled column sections.

        \subsubsection{Reboiler side}
            The reboiler side is modeled much like an equilibrium stage in the column, considering the entering 
            and leaving streams as depicted in \figref{sec:mathpro:steady:conreb}. However in contrast to the 
            equations supplied for a column section, no integer optimization terms will have to be considered. 
            Furthermore no side draws, or separate feeds are recognized. With that the material balances are
            \Eq{}{
                0 = L_{reb}^{in} x_{i,reb}^{in} - L_{reb}^{out} x_{i}^{reb} - V_{reb}^{out} y_{i}^{reb}, \eqannc .
            }
            The energy balance taking into account the transferred energy ($Q_{CR}$) becomes therefore
            \Eq{}{
                0 = L_{reb}^{in} h_{reb}^{in} - L_{reb}^{out} h^L_{reb} - V_{reb}^{out} h^V_{reb} + Q_{CR}.
            }
            The equilibrium and summation equations are analogous to the ones presented for the column model.
            A pressure drop again is assigned with relation to the lowest column stage.

        \subsubsection{Condenser side}
            The condenser is modeled as a total condenser. The mass and component balances therefore become trivial
            \Eq{}{
                x_{i,con} & = y_{i,con}^{in}, \eqannc, \\
                V_{con}^{in} & = L_{con}^{out}.
            }
            The temperature is set to the bubble temperature of the given mixture at an assigned pressure. The
            enthalpies of the entering and leaving stream can therefore be calculated from the given EOS. And
            the energy balance determines the transferred energy
            \Eq{}{
                0 = V_{con}^{in} h_{con}^{in} - L_{con}^{out} h^L_{con} - Q_{CR}.
            }

\subsection{Heat exchange}
\label{sec:mathpro:steady:hx}
    \todo{adjust heat exchange section to current approach.}
    The issue of heat integration is essential to the economic performance of cryogenic air separation. Foremost
    one must consider the special column configuration used in the process. Since operation of the condenser in the
    low pressure section only becomes possible if the reboiler in the high pressure section functions as heat sink,
    no external utilities are supplied to either unit. Rather they are combined into a single heat exchange unit. Thus
    the absolute value of the reboiler energy must matched by the energy recovered from the condenser. Furthermore
    the material streams entering the process can -- and should -- exchange heat with the process streams leaving it.
    The combined condenser / reboiler for LPC / HPC column is assumed as a given heat exchange. This makes sense insofar,
    as this is a necessity in terms of the actual physical implementation of the process units. Also the usage of the
    oxygen rich liquid from the HPC as coolant in the Argon condenser is assumed as fixed.

    This leaves the process stream leaving the compression stage of the process as well as all product and waste streams
    leaving the process. All those streams are -- for simulation purposes and also in some process implementations  -- fed
    into a single multi-stream heat exchange unit. In actual processes all heat exchange and much of the process operations
    take place in the so called ''cold box''. As such a heavily insulated area is referred to. This is done to minimize
    heat exchange with the surroundings. Therefore and for further reasons compact heat exchange units such as plate-fin
    multi-stream heat exchangers are favoured when dealing with cryogenic processes in general and the cryogenic air septation
    in particular.

    Due to the importance of heat integration to the ASU process some thought sould be given as to what modelling approach
    should be employed. Although the field of heat integration is one of the most intensively studied within process engineering,
    only  a limited amount of approaches is available in open literature \cite{Kamath.2012}.

    Traditionally heat integration has been carried out in a sequential manner, where it is for the purposes of process
    optimization assumed, that all heating and cooling is done by external utilities. After an (locally) optimal
    process configuration is identified, all hot and cold streams within the process are identified, and their
    temperature intervals fixed. %In the context of heat integration hot and cold streams do not refer to whether a given
    %stream has a subjectively high or low temperature, but rather whether a given stream needs to be cooled (hot) or
    %heated (cold) within the process. %
    In subsequent steps first the minimum utility requirements, and maximum number of heat exchangers are identified,
    and a specific heat exchange network (HEN) is designed. \todo{add citation Lindhoff...}
    While this approach has been successfully applied to a multitude of processes and led to substantial savings,
    it is questionable if such a sequential approach will yield an optimal or near optimal solution.

    Therefore some efforts have been made to develop efficient strategies for simultaneous process optimization
    and heat integration. Two general approaches can be distinguished. The first one based on the pinch concept.
    \todoil{}{elaborate on pinch concept?} These methods are able to identify the minimum heat requirement
    as well as stream temperatures during process optimization. The first model along these lines was published
    by Duran and Grossmann \cite{Duran.1986} in 1986. They introduced a limited number of quite well behaved
    constraints into the optimization model to ensure no minimum driving force violations. Recently
    this model has been extended to handle phase changes and by fixing the utilities to zero been applied
    to the design of a multi-stream heat exchanger \cite{Kamath.2012}. The major drawback with these methods
    \todoil{}{read about and mention transshipment model by Moriari (sequential)}
    is that one cannot target area of a given heat exchanger as the approach temperatures are not computed
    by the model. Therefore the sometimes substantial trade-off between the cost for heat exchange area
    and utility cost cannot be regarded.

    A second approach employs superstructures of a HEN to find optimal matchings of process streams. No pinch
    point calculations are required, as the actual heat exchange is more or less modeled explicitly. This
    leads to the benefit, that approach temperatures as well as exchanged heat duties between each stream coupling
    are known within the model, and the cost of the designed unit can be considered in an economic objective
    function.

    The approach and respective superstructure adapted in this thesis were first published by Yee and Grossmann
    \cite{Yee.1990}. \Figref{fig:HX_super} shows the stage wise superstructure for a HEN consisting of two hot
    and two cold streams.

    \begin{figure}
        \input{Pictures/HX_superstructure}
        \caption{Superstructure for multi-stream heat exchanger. \cite{Yee.1990}}
        \label{fig:HX_super}
    \end{figure}
%    \stdfig{Pictures/HX_superstructure}{Superstructure for multi-stream heat exchanger. \cite{Yee.1990}}{fig:HX_super}{}

    In this stagewise structure each hot stream can exchange heat with each cold stream within each stage.
    The following assumptions were made when the model was developed
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Constant heat capacities
        \item Constant heat transfer coefficients
        \item Countercurrent heat exchangers
        \item Isothermal mixing at each stage.
    \end{itemize}

    The assumption of constant heat capacities is a common one in the design of HEN's. When no phase boundaries are passed
    and the temperature range of the involved is not too wide, it is a reasonably good approximation of the real conditions.
    While constant heat transfer coefficients a re assumed the model leaves the flexibility to define different
    coefficients for each pairing of hot and cold streams. Countercurrent heat exchangers are common in industrial practice.
    This assumption however does not really pose a limitation, as the model can easily be altered to account for concurrent
    units.

    The last assumption of isothermal mixing is a more major one. It has been introduced as it allows for significant
    simplifications and leads to a model, where all constraints are linear and all non-linearities are restricted
    to the objective function. While that is certainly not true for the entire process model, it should at least
    allow for some reductions in the model complexity. The assumption states, that regardless of which streams a
    given stream exchanges heat with, it will leave at the same temperature. Due to that all energy balances around
    each unit in the superstructure can be eliminated as well as the subsequent mixing of the streams.

    \paragraph{Model equations}

    First of all a heat balance at each stage is necessary
    \Eq{}{
        F_i (T_{i, \ell} - T_{i, \ell+1}) = \sum_j q_{ijk} \\
        f_j (T_{i, \ell} - T_{i, \ell+1}) = \sum_i q_{ijk}
    }

    The heat exchange area $A_{hx}$ can be computed from the exchanged energy, the heat transfer coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$
    and the logarithmic mean temperature difference $LMTD$.
    \Eq{}{
        A_{hx} = \sum_i \sum_j \sum_k \frac{q_{ijk}}{\alpha_{ij} * LMDT_{ijk} + \delta}
    }

    While the small number $\delta$ is included to avoid problems in the program, when $LMDT$ becomes zero
    In order to avoid further numerical difficulties when the approach temperatures $\Delta T_{ij}$ at each side of an exchange
    unit approach zero, it was proposed to use an approximation introduced by Chen \cite{Chen.1987}
    \Eq{}{
        LMDT_{ijk} \approx \left[ \Delta T_{ijk} \cdot \Delta T_{ijk+1} \frac{\Delta T_{ijk} + \Delta T_{ijk+1}}{2} \right]^{\frac{1}{3}}.
    }

    While the approach temperatures are defined as
    \Eq{}{
        \Delta T_{ijk} = \max \left\{0, T_{ik} - T_{jk}\right\}
    }
    AS the $\max$ function is non-smooth and thus non differentiable at the points $T_{ik} = T_{jk}$, \gproms internally uses a smooth
    approximation. The exact for of which is unknown to the author.

\subsection{Compression \& expansion}
\label{sec:mathpro:steady:comp}
    \todo{revise compressor equations and add equations to nomenclature}
    The issue of cooling the ambient air to process temperatures at around $90 K$ is not an easy
    one. The main hindrance is, that a heat sink at this temperature level is not readily available.
    Lucky thermodynamics offer a different way to reach such temperatures. In order to do so,
    the ambient air first needs to be compressed and then expanded again. Cooling then occurs
    by either exploiting the \emph{Joule-Thompson} effect or isentropic expansion. First a few
    comments are made about the compression stage, while afterwards the governing principles
    for cooling by expansion will be described.

    \subsubsection{Multi-stage compression}
        \begin{figure}
            \center
            \input{pgfplots/Compressor}
            \caption{Multi-stage compression.}
            \label{fig:multi_stage_compression}
        \end{figure}

        Compressors and expanders are among the most common process equipment. A multitude of processes
        utilizes them as primary or auxiliary units. In the context of cryogenic air separation the
        compression plays a major role, as it enables to reach temperatures needed for liquefying
        air and gases in general. As the compression of gases is always associated with a significant
        reduction in volume it requires large amounts of energy. Thus in addition to significantly
        contributing to the capital cost of the process the compression stage is responsible for
        the majority of the operating cost encountered in the ASU process.

        The rigorous modeling of continuous flow machines in terms of unit operations poses great challenges.
        For specific units it may be undertaken by means of CFD simulations or employing characteristics diagrams,
        which require extensive experiments or can be obtained from the manufacturer.
        For the purposes of process design however a simpler approach with unit efficiencies is appropriate.

        As a significant temperature increase goes along with the compression of air and in order to reduce
        the energy demand of the compression in general, it is beneficial, to use a multi stage compressor with
        inter-cooling stages as depicted in \figref{fig:multi_stage_compression}. This yields a lower energy consumption
        as a single stage unit for the same compression ratio.

        Subsequently the working equations for the compressor model used in the scope of this thesis are
        briefly summarized.

        A trivial material and component balance around the compressor yields the outlet molar flow-rate $F^{out}$
        as well as the outlet overall composition $z^{out}$
    	\Eq{eq:comp:MassBalance}{
    		0 = F^{in} - F^{out},
    	}%
    	\Eq{eq:comp:CompBalance}{
    		0 = z_i^{in} - z_i^{out} \eqannc.
    	}%

    	To calculate the mechanical work associated with the desired compression,
        first the isentropic case
    	\Eq{eq:comp:SInOut}{
    		S^{in} = S^{out}
    	}%
        is considered.
    	\Eq{eq:comp:IsentropicWork}{
    		W_S = F^{in} \cdot (H^{in} - H^{out})
    	}%

    	\Eq{eq:comp:WEta}{
    		W \cdot \eta^C = W_S
    	}%
    	\Eq{eq:comp:CompressionWork}{
    		W_S = F^{in} \cdot H^{in}(T^{in}, p^{in}, z_i^{in}) - F^{out} \cdot H^{out}(T^{out}, p^{out}, z_i^{out})
    	}%
        \todo{complete compressor equations}
        
    	\Eq{eq:comp:PressureDrop}{
    		p^{out} = p^{in} + \Delta p
    	}%

    \subsubsection{Cooling by expansion}
        The liquefaction of gases requires temperatures well below ambient conditions. In order to attain
        such conditions one cannot utilize natural occurring coolants as they are not available at the required 
        temperature level. Rather cooling effects that can occur during the expansion of gases are exploited. 
        First we consider the expansion through an expansion valve or so called \emph{Joule-Thompson} - valve. 
        In an rather accurate approximation, expansion through a valve can approximated as an isenthalpic 
        process ($h_1 = h_2$). To describe the change in temperature during isenthalpic expansion 
        the \emph{Joule-Thompson} coefficient
        \Eq{}{
            \mu_{JT} = \left(\fracddpart{T}{p}\right)_h,
        }
        which denotes pressure derivative of the temperature at constant enthalpy can be considered.
        This can be transformed into
        \Eq{}{
            \mu_{JT} = \frac{1}{c_p} \left[T \left(\fracddpart{v}{T}\right)_p - v \right]
        }
        \ncg{\mu_{JT}}{\emph{Joule-Thompson} coeffivcient}{\frac{K}{Pa}}

        \todo{elaborate on different terms.}
        \todo{add derivative in appendix?}

        \begin{figure}
            \center
            \input{GNUPlot/pr_isenthalpes}
            \caption{Isenthalpes computed by Peng-Robinson EOS.}
            \label{fig:pr_isenthalpes}
        \end{figure}
%        \stdfig{GNUPlot/pr_isenthalpes}{Isenthalpes computed by Peng-Robinson model.}{fig:pr_isenthalpes}{}

        If we employ the Peng-Robinson equation of state, which is appropriate for this mildly non-ideal system 
        \cite{AndreasPfennig.2003}, we can plot the isenthalpes for ambient air ($x_{N_2}=0.7812$, $x_{O_2}=0.2095$,
        $x_{Ar}=0.0093$ ) in a PT-diagramm (\figref{fig:pr_isenthalpes}).
        There we can see, that in certain ranges a decrease in pressure at constant enthalpy will result 
        in an increase in temperature, while for other regions temperature decreases. It is interesting 
        to mention that the non-idealities of a given gas give rise to this effect. For an ideal gas the 
        temperature change at isenthalpic expansion would always be zero. Luckily for the cryogenic engineer 
        real gases deviate from ideal behaviour especially at elevated pressures and low temperatures \cite{Barron.1985}. 
        It is therefore important to give some consideration to the thermodynamic model used to describe the properties 
        of the system in question, as the non-ideal properties need to be captured appropriately.

        A different way of expanding a compressed gas, is by letting it produce work in an fluid kinetic machine.
        If one assumes an adiabatic devices and disregards irreversible effects, this process can be viewed as
        isentropic. Analogous to the isenthalpic case an isentropic expansion coefficient can be defined
        \Eq{}{
            \mu_S = \left( \fracddpart{T}{p} \right)_S = \frac{T}{c_p} \left( \fracddpart{v}{T} \right)_p.
        }%
        \ncg{\mu_S}{isentropic expansion coefficient}{\frac{K}{Pa}}

        Here the derivative in the second form corresponds to the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion
        $\beta$, which is always positive for gases, which in turn means, that an isentropic expansion
        will always result in an temperature decrease, whereas the isentropic expansion only led to a decrease for
        specific conditions. Furthermore an isentropic expansion over the same pressure range will always result in
        lower temperatures than an isenthalpic expansion. The reason that isentropic valves are most commonly used 
        in liquefaction systems, is that those work producing machines cannot handle significant phase changes, 
        which is after all the desired result of liquefaction.

        Traditionally only the isenthalpic expansion had been used within the cryogenic air separation process,
        since -- as mentioned before -- the air needs to be liquefied in order to be fed into be distilled. However
        in modern process configurations the isentropic expansion is also considered to recover some of energy 
        form the compression.
