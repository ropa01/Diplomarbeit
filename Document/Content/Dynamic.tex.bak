    The previously described model is based on a steady state assumption. This means that all variables do not
    change with time. While a model like that offers valuable insight into the operation of a process many
    aspects remain unclear. In order to gain further insight into the process the dynamics have to be considered.

    Due to that in this section a dynamic model of the ASU process will be developed.

\subsubsection{balance equations}
    First the balance equations have to be rewritten in dynamic form. To do so reservoir terms or holdups
    are introduced. Namely the component holdups $n_{ij}$ and internal energy $U_j$ for each stage.

    \paragraph{$n_C - 1$ component balances}
        \Eqml{eq:col:CompBalance_opt}{
    		\fracdd{n_{ij}}{t} = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot y_{i,j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)
                \cdot L_j \cdot x_{i,j} - V_{j+1} \cdot y_{i,j+1} \\ \hfill - L_{j-1} \cdot x_{i,j-1}
                - \sum_{k=1}^{F^V} \zeta_{kj} \cdot F_j^V \cdot z^V_{i,j} - \sum_{l=1}^{F^L}%
                \zeta_{lj} \cdot F_j^L \cdot z_{i,j}^L - \zeta^R_j \cdot V_N \cdot y_{iN}, \hfill%
                \\ \eqannote{i = 1 \dots n_C-1, \quad j = 1 \dots N, \quad k = 1 \dots n_F, \quad l = 1 \dots n_F}.
    	}%
    \paragraph{Total internal energy balance}
        \Eqml{eq:col:EnergyBalance}{
    		\fracdd{U_j}{t} = \left(1 + s_j^V\right) \cdot V_j \cdot h^V_{j} + \left(1 + s_j^L\right)
                \cdot L_j \cdot h^L_{j} - V_{j+1} \cdot h^V_{j+1} \\ \hfill - L_{j-1} \cdot h^L_{j-1}
                - \sum_{k=1}^{F^V} \zeta_{kj} \cdot F_k^V \cdot h^{FV}_{j} - \sum_{l=1}^{F^L}
                \zeta_{lj} \cdot F_j^L \cdot h^{FL}_{j} - \zeta^R_j \cdot V_N \cdot h^V_{N}, \hfill
                \\ \eqannote{i = 1 \dots n_C, \quad j = 1 \dots n, \quad k = 1 \dots n_F, \quad l = 1 \dots n_F}.
    	}%

    \ncr{n_{ij}}{holdup of component $i$ on stage $j$ }{mol}
    \ncr{U_j}{internal energy holdup on stage $j$}{J}

\subsubsection{constituent equations}
    In addition to the balance equations further constituent equations need to be introduced. From the
    steady state model we know the equilibrium equations
    \Eq{eq:col:Kxy}{
        y_{ij} & = K_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}, \eqanncs,
    }%

    and the summation equations

    \Eq{eq:col:summ_dyn}{
        1 & = \sum_i^{n_c} y_{ij} \eqanns, \\
        1 & = \sum_i^{n_c} x_{ij} \eqanns.
    }%

    Furthermore the accumulation of moles in each stage in vapour $n_j^V$ and liquid $n_j^L$
    need to be considered with

    \Eq{eq:col:holdup}{
        n_{ij} & = x_{ij} n_j^L + y_{ij} n_j^V \eqanncs, \\
    }%
    \ncr{n_j^L}{liquid molar holdup on stage $j$}{mol}
    \ncr{n_j^V}{vapour molar holdup on stage $j$}{mol}

    These holdups are linked by the volume of a given stage $V_{stage}$. Thus the volume constraint
    can be written as

    \Eq{eq:dyn:volconstraint}{
        V_{stage} = \frac{n_j^V}{\varrho_j^V} + \frac{n_j^L}{\varrho_j^L} \eqanns.
    }%
    \ncr{V_{stage}}{stage volume}{m^3}

    The internal energy in a stage corresponds to its enthalpy, reduced by pressure term
    \Eq{eq:dyn:internergyholdup}{
        U_j = n^L_j \cdot h^L_j + n^V_j \cdot h^V_j - p_j \cdot V_{stage}
    }

    \subsubsection{Hydraulics}
    \todoil{}{write somewhere that stage indices will be omitted for convenience.}

    As we are no longer dealing in steady state hydraulic equations need to be introduces,
    which determine the liquid and vapour flow rates leaving a separation stage. As the
    mechanisms driving these flows might be very different depending on the type of internals
    used, it is not surprising that the corresponding equations are also very different. In the
    given model both trayed columns and columns with structured packing are employed.

    \paragraph{Trayed} column hydraulics can be approximated by the following system of equations.
    All equations presented here were taken from \cite{92}.

    The liquid flow rates are calculated from the well established francis formula ,
    derived from the law of Bernoulli and taking effects like bubbling into account

    \Eq{eq:col:francis}{
        L_j = \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{2 g} \varrho^L_j \ell_{weir} \Phi h_{ow}^{\frac{2}{3}} \eqanns.
    }%
    \ncc{g}{gravitational constant}{\frac{m}{s^2}}
    \ncr{\ell_{weir}}{length of tray weir}{m}
    \ncr{h_{ow}}{height over weir}{m}
    \ncg{\Phi}{relative froth density}{-}

    Where $h_{ow}$ denotes the height of the liquid over the weir, which can be calculated from the
    froth height $h_f$ and the weir height $h_w$
    \Eq{}{
        h_{ow} = h_f - h_w.
    }
    \ncr{h_f}{froth height}{m}
    \ncr{h_w}{weir height}{m}

    While the weir height is a tray design parameter the froth height is computed from the clear
    liquid height and the relative froth density
    \Eq{}{
        h_f = \frac{n^L \, MW^L}{A_{active} \, \varrho^L \, \Phi}.
    }
    \ncr{A_{active}}{active tray area}{m^2}

    Lastly in terms of liquid flow rates, the relative froth density is dependent on the
    degree of aeration within the liquid, expressed by the aeration factor $\beta$
    from an empirical equation
    \Eq{}{
        \beta_j & = 1 - 0.3593 \left( \frac{V_{j-1} \, MW^V_{j-1}}{A_{active} \, \sqrt{\varrho_{j-1}}} \right)^{0.177709} \eqanns, \\
        \Phi_j & = 2 \beta_j - 1.
    }
    \ncg{\beta}{aeration factor}{-}


    The pressure difference between stages is the driving force for the vapour streams. The pressure drop
    is modeled as having two contributions, the dray and wet pressure drop. While dry pressure drop
    stems from the vapour flowing through the holes with in tray, the wet pressure drop is caused by the liquid
    holdup on the stage.
    \todoil{}{add right equation and discuss pressure drop for structured packings.}
    \Eq{eq:col:dp_dyn}{
        p_j - p_{j+1} = h_{j}^{liq} \varrho_j^L g + 0.5 \xi \varrho_{j+1}^V \left( \frac{q_{j+1}^V}{A_h} \right)^2
    }%

    \paragraph{Structured packings} and their hydraulic behaviour are currently still under investigation. The number 
    of available correlations for calculation of internal flow-rates is much more limited than for trays or even 
    dumped packings. Among the most established models is the one developed by Bravo et al. \cite{Rocha.1993} at the 
    University of Texas. This model has been extended to be valid in the loading region and account for different types 
    of packing material \cite{Gualito.1997}. As main linking factor between vapour and liquid flow-rates as well as 
    the pressure drop, the liquid holdup has bee identified by the authors. It is expressed in dimensionless form
