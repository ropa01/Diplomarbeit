\chapter{Process Design}
\label{chp:proces_design}

Once a particular reaction or production sequence has been developed in a laboratory it needs to be scaled 
up to produce the desired product in quantities large enough to meet market demand to a price that allows 
competative prices. This is where process design comes into play. At the begin of the design process often 
only the raw material as well as the desired products, along with the necessary chemical reactions are 
specified. It is then the task of the process engineer to find a series of production steps which lead to the 
production of this product. Each step denotes a specific function and the connected functions form a process.
 At the end each specific function has to be assigned a specific technical realization. 

Usually there are numerous options available to perform certain tasks and in order to be realized any 
endeavor will need to yield acceptable profits. Different options will therefore have to be compared  from an 
engineering and an economic standpoint alike. For complex processes the amount of possible options 
becomes enormous. Too many to be manually examined and evaluated.

Process Engineers have to rely on heuristics to limit the number of options and identify the most promising 
candidates for further studies. These candidates can then be compared in terms of economic performance. 
In order to do so one has to rely on simulation studies and experiments. As experiments and the construction 
of pilot plants are very costly the aim is to minimize those. WIth the rise in available computing power the 
numerical simulation of processes has become a very powerful tool to support the design process and has 
the ability to replace numerous experiments. Not only can possible options be evaluated but also can 
optimal process configurations from a limited pool of options be generated. 

To conduct simulation studies first a process model needs to be created. This models in its most general 
case is a set of partial differential and algebraic equations. When formulating the model great care needs 
to be applied, as any simulation study can only be as accurate as the underlying model. The process 
engineer is faces with the task to find an adequate representation of the physical system which delivers 
meaningful results within an reasonable amount of time. Further enhanced is this problem when the model 
is to be used in model predictive control, where (approximate) solutions of complex systems might need to 
be available within seconds or fractions of a second. 

In the following sections some general considerations on the physical and economic modeling of chemical process will be given, before in the next chapter those will be applied to real-life problem at hand. AS uncertainty

\section{Economic Considerations}
\label{sec:uncertainty}

Aside from question wether a certain process is capable of producing products according to its 
specifications, it needs to be investigated if it does so in an economically viable manner. The modeling 
of process economics is a powerful tool to estimate project profitability. The evaluation of process 
economics has three major aims in the design phase. 

\regitemize{%
	\item{Compare design options with regard to profitability.}
	\item{Economically optimize a given design.}
	\item{Estimate project profitability}
}%

In any case the total cost of the project as well as the cash flow structure will have to be analyzed to supply 
an accurate estimate of the economic conditions. Furthermore an adequate measure to compare and 
analyze a project in economic terms needs to be employed. 

The following sections will first describe how to estimate the total project cost in different stages of the 
design process. Subsequently different ways of measuring a projects profitability will be discussed. 

\subsection{Project cost}
An important factor in every given project is the total cost. During the design of a chemical process many 
important aspects of the future cost structure are unknown, as the final design is in development. In 
general the total cost of implementing and operating a production site can be broken down into several 
subcategories. 

\regitemize{%
	\item{Battery limit investment}
	\item{Utility investment}
	\item{Off-Site investment}
	\item{Engineering fees}
	\item{Working capital}
}%

We will now look closer at each of these subcategories. 

\subsubsection{Battery limit investment} denotes all investments necessary to have all required equipment 
for process operations installed on-site. This includes structures necessary to house the process as well as
 delivery and installation of all individual assets.  One major part of these cost will the the process 
 equipment. As the exact manufacturers and models of the equipment will not be known in early design 
 stages, a different approach has to be chosen. Various process parameters such as temperatures, 
 pressures and handled volumes will have an effect of the required equipment. High pressure tanks will 
 most likely be more expensive as stronger materials and thicker walls will be necessary. Each piece of 
 equipment will have an specific feature that most influences its cost. For vessels and reactors this might be 
 volume, while for heat exchangers the required heat exchange area. The equipment price $C_E$ can be 
 approximated by a simple power law
\eq{
	C_E = C_B \left( \frac{Q}{Q_B} \right)^M. 
	\label{eq:equip_cost}
}%
\nomenclature{$C_E$}{Equipment cost \nomunit{\$}}
\nomenclature{$C_B$}{Reference equipment cost \nomunit{\$}}
\nomenclature{$Q$}{Equipment specific quantity \nomunit{-}}
\nomenclature{$Q_B$}{Equipment specific reference quantity \nomunit{-}}
\nomenclature{$M$}{Equipment specific factor \nomunit{-}}

A reference price $C_B$ is multiplied by the determining quantity $Q$ normalized to a reference state 
$Q_B$ and raised to the power $M$ specific to each piece of equipment. Reference prices for various 
installations can be obtained from literature. 
\todo[inline]{add reference}
As the overall price structure may change dramatically over time these prices will have to be adjusted to 
current time. To do so several indices have been developed
\eq{
	\frac{C_1}{C_2} = \frac{index_1}{index_2}. 
	\label{eq:index_ratio}
}%
\nomenclature{$C_1$}{Reference equipment cost at time $1$ \nomunit{\$}}
\nomenclature{$C_2$}{Reference equipment cost at time $2$ \nomunit{\$}}
\nomenclature{$index_1$}{index at time $1$ \nomunit{-}}
\nomenclature{$index_2$}{index at time $2$ \nomunit{-}}

While for each index an arbitrary reference year is chosen. Among the most common indices are the 
Marshall \& Swift index (1926: $index = 100$) or the Nellson-Farrar-Index (1946: $index = 100$)

As mentioned before aside from the mere size of the equipment the process conditions will also affect the 
price. The predominant factors to that respect are pressure, temperature and the question wether corrosive 
or reactive media will be present.
