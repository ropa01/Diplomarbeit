Fuzzy multiple attribute decisions involve two processes, the rating and the ranking of alternatives. If the rating results are crisp then the ranking procedure becomes straightforward; hence, the emphasis of this paper is on obtaining crisp ratings for alternatives. In order to aid the decision maker to express his/her attribute preferences, new elicitation techniques to determine attributes importance are proposed. These techniques range from statistical to scaling methods based on linguistic variables, and so enable a more versatile elicitation procedure as well as providing crisp preferences.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to refinery planning under uncertainty.  To calc. the expectation of plant revenues, which is the main difficulty of the problem, loss functions are derived and applied.  Different std. loss function approxn. methods are compared and integrated into the planning model.  The results show that the piecewise-linear approxn. of the loss function can obtain good accuracy with improved soln. speed.  A general formulation for revenue and cost calcns. is proposed by considering uncertainty in both the raw material and the product demand.  To handle possible unmet customer demands, the hard-to-specify penalty functions of the two-stage programming are avoided and replaced by two of the decision maker's service objectives, namely, confidence level and fill rate.  Confidence level, which is the probability of satisfying customer demands, is commonly used in chance-constrained programming.  However, fill rate, which is the proportion of demands that are met by a plant, is a greater concern of most managers.  Fill rates are effectively calcd. using the loss function.  The max. plant profit that satisfies certain fill rate objectives can then be obtained.  Case studies show that a planning strategy that satisfies certain confidence level objectives might be overly lenient compared to a strategy that satisfies a fill rate objective.  Because very few refinery planning models consider the influences of uncertainty, case studies including real-world large-scale refinery planning problems are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The effectiveness of the designed controller has been proved through the comparison between the linear MPC approach, that handles absolute and rate-of-change constraints, and a more conventional control configuration. The results show a significant reduction in overshoots and settling time during load variations.

Rather than operating at a fixed steady state, it may be profitable to switch among different operating conditions because of variability of electrical prices and product demands. This article addresses the problem of determining the optimal daily multiperiod operating conditions for an air separation process under variable electricity pricing and uncertain product demands. The multiperiod nonlinear programming formulation includes a rigorous nonlinear model of the highly-coupled process, and decision variables include the operating conditions within each period, as well as the transition times. Demand uncertainty is treated using the loss function included in the objective function and constraints on customer satisfaction levels.

 abstract = {Cryogenic air separation is an efficient technology for supplying large quantities of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen to chemical, petroleum and manufacturing customers. However, numerous uncertainties make effective operation of these complex processes difficult. This work addresses the problem of determining an optimal operating strategy to maximize the total profit of a cryogenic air separation process while considering demand uncertainty and contractual obligations. A rigorous process model is included as constraints in a nonlinear programming formulation. Uncertain demands are assumed to be normally distributed with known mean and standard deviation, and expected profit in the objective function is evaluated using the standard loss function. A probabilistic fill-rate expression, also based on the loss function, is used to model the contractual obligations by providing a lower bound on the expected product sales. In the single period case with one customer satisfaction constraint, the nonlinear programming formulation can be solved efficiently using the general purpose nonlinear optimization package, Ipopt. This formulation is then extended to include multiple time periods, the potential for product storage, and customer satisfaction constraints on multiple products. To solve the large-scale nonlinear programming formulation that considers a seven-day operating horizon, a tailored parallel nonlinear programming algorithm is used. This approach makes use of a Schur complement decomposition strategy to exploit the block structure of the problem and allow efficient solution in parallel. Using these tools, we solve for a set of optimal operating strategies over the complete space of different fill rates. This produces planning figures that identify key trade-offs between profitability and contractual obligations.},

Effective design can improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption, however, uncertainties can make determination of the optimal design difficult. This paper addresses the conceptual design of cryogenic air separation process under uncertainty. A rigorous, highly nonlinear model of three integrated columns is developed to capture the coupled nature of the process. The multi-scenario approach is used to incorporate the uncertainty, giving rise to a nonlinear programming problem with over half a million variables. Nevertheless, this problem is solved efficiently using Ipopt, demonstrating the effectiveness of interior-point methods on complex, large-scale nonlinear programming problems. The optimal design from the multi-scenario approach is compared against the optimal design using nominal parameter values. As expected, the results using the multi-scenario approach are more conservative than the nominal case; however, they may be less conservative than traditional overdesign factors.},

The mass and energy balances for the process are represented by a simplified algebraic model in which material stream flows and pressures appear as continuous variables and the various equipment choices for components of the air separation cycle are represented by binary variables. The resulting model corresponds to a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation and enables numerical optimization of the cycle. The two problems addressed are the selection of the optimal equipment set for a given product slate and the flexibility determination of the chosen cycle. The flexibility analysis is complemented with unique visual techniques that depict the feasible region and use of the recently proposed convex-hull approach.

Apart from requiring detailed information about probability distribution functions, this approach also has the drawback that the computational expense of solving these models is very high. In this work, we present a non-probabilistic treatment of scheduling optimization under uncertainty, where we describe the imprecision and uncertainty in the task durations using concepts from fuzzy set theory. We first provide a brief review on the fuzzy set approach, comparing it with the probabilistic approach. We then present mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models derived from applying this approach to two different problems---flowshop scheduling and new product development process scheduling---and show how they can be used to predict most likely, optimistic and pessimistic values of metrics such as the makespan. Results indicate that these MILP models are computationally tractable for reasonably sized problems. We also describe tabu search implementations in order to handle larger problems.},

 abstract = {In this work, we provide an overview of our previously published works on incorporating demand uncertainty in midterm planning of multisite supply chains. A stochastic programming based approach is described to model the planning process as it reacts to demand realizations unfolding over time. In the proposed bilevel-framework, the manufacturing decisions are modeled as `here-and-now' decisions, which are made before demand realization. Subsequently, the logistics decisions are postponed in a `wait-and-see' mode to optimize in the face of uncertainty. In addition, the trade-off between customer satisfaction level and production costs is also captured in the model. The proposed model provides an effective tool for evaluating and actively managing the exposure of an enterprises assets (such as inventory levels and profit margins) to market uncertainties. The key features of the proposed framework are highlighted through a supply chain planning case study.},

@article{Diehl.2008,
 abstract = {Nonlinear equality and inequality constrained optimization problems with uncertain parameters can be addressed by a robust worst-case formulation that leads to a bi-level min--max optimization problem.We propose and investigate a numerical method to solve this min--max optimization problem exactly in the case that the underlying maximization problem always has its solution on the boundary of the uncertainty set. This is an adoption of the local reduction approach used to solve generalized semi-infinite programs. The approach formulates an equilibrium constraint employing first order derivatives of both the uncertainty set and the user defined constraints. We propose two different ways for computation of these derivatives, one similar to the forward mode, the other similar to the reverse mode of automatic differentiation. We show the equivalence of the proposed approach to a method based on geometric considerations that was recently developed by some of the authors. We show how to generalize the techniques to optimal control problems. The robust dynamic optimization of a batch distillation illustrates that both techniques are numerically efficient and able to overcome the inexactness of another recently proposed numerical approach to address uncertainty in optimal control problems.},

@article{Georgiadis.1999,
 abstract = {This paper presents developments toward a unified framework for incorporating both process flexibility and robustness (in terms of product quality) criteria in process optimization under uncertainty. A robust design methodology, known as the Taguchi approach, is discussed in the context of uncertainty, and some limitations are identified. Taguchi's method is then extended to take into account process constraints and probabilistic uncertainty. A framework for establishing the interactions and synergistic benefits between the two operability objectives is proposed, based on an expected measure, where product quality losses are taken into account explicitly. Tradeoffs between stochastic flexibility and a robust criterion are explored in order to depict optimal operating policies in the presence of uncertainty; extensions toward design optimization are also briefly discussed. A number of examples is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework.},

paper presents first a brief overview of the considerable work that has been performed for the systematic synthesis of process flowsheets and corresponding subsystems. Next, it is argued that a number of important research challenges remain to be solved with major themes being fundamental integration of different synthesis methodologies, improved robustness of optimization-based methods for predicting solutions of good quality, and improved capabilities for handling larger problems. In order to illustrate how some of these challenges are being addressed with the use of optimization-based techniques, we describe work in the areas of integration of logic in mixed-integer optimization, global
optimization of nonlinear programming models, and rigorous preliminary screening for MINLP models. Numerical results will be presented to illustrate the usefulness and potential of these methods.},
